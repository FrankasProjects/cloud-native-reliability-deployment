Profitability and revenue maximization are the most important goals for any cloud service provider which can be employed through different pricing models. Historically, cloud providers were following the fixed pricing strategies while provisioning their services to the clients. However, these approaches have their own shortcomings resulting in resource wastage, lack of fairness and user satisfaction. With expansion of cloud users in market every day, provisioning of fair resource allocation with service differentiation and efficient pricing model is demand seeking, resulting in a shift from static to dynamic pricing models. In this paper, we discuss and investigate different pricing scheme with respect to their advantages, limitations and possible future directions.

The industry of cloud computing services is in its infancy, and firms employ pricing models based on conventional information goods. We offer a new approach to cloud services pricing considering the consumer discounting behavior. First, we propose a baseline model based on a profit maximizing duopolistic market serving to both rational and time inconsistent users. Our results reveal that the firms can profit from impatient users. In addition, we extend the baseline model with the effect of delayed network externalities because, by nature, information goods exhibit this property strongly. For the latter case, we show that the effect of network externalities reduces the impact of low switching costs and the monopolist benefits from time-inconsistent behavior.

Cloud services are priced at different levels in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud market. For example, Amazon EC2 offers its cloud resources with three pricing schemes, the subscription model, pay-as-you-go model and spot pricing model. With more and more IaaS cloud service providers (CSPs) beginning to provide cloud services, they form a competitive market to compete for cloud users. Therefore, how to set optimal prices in order to maximize their revenue in a competitive IaaS cloud computing market while at the same time meeting the cloud users' demand satisfaction is a problem that CSPs should consider. Towards this end, in this paper, we study subscription pricing competition in a duopoly IaaS cloud computing market. First, we analyze whether or not the cloud users choose to use cloud service.

To attract users, cloud providers offer their resources as services at reasonable prices and provide various price models to reflect higher level of quality of service (QoS), which are referred as pricing schemes. $k$k-times anonymous authentication ($k$k-TAA) is an attractive approach to construct pricing schemes, providing access controllability, user anonymity and public traceability. In $k$k-TAA schemes, authenticated users are permitted to anonymously access services from a provider at most $k$k times, while the ones whose the number of access times exceeds $k$k can be publicly traced. That is, $k$k-TAA schemes offer a prepaid plan that charges users based on the amount of access times. Alternatively, pay-as-you-go (PAYG) is a pricing strategy that allows users to be charged based on the amount of usage, reducing the costs on unnecessary resources. Adopting $k$k-TAA schemes to PAYG model, the access bound $k$k is decided by the prepayment amount and the service usage is tracked by the number of access times. However, this approach is impractical, since existing $k$k-TAA schemes only allow an one-time access in an authentication. This article aims to bridge this gap in the literature by designing an efficient and secure authentication system for PAYG cloud computing, supporting flexible access controllability, user anonymity and public traceability. To achieve this, we propose a new $k$k-TAA primitive, called $k$k-times anonymous pay-as-you-go authentication ($k$k-TAA-PAYG), that allows users to access services for multiple times in an authentication as long as the number of their access times does not exceed $k$k. We first formalize the definition and security model for $k$k-TAA-PAYG scheme. Subsequently, we present a concrete construction of $k$k-TAA-PAYG scheme, with the computational complexity as $O(1)$O(1) and the constant communicational cost. Finally, comparing with the most efficient $k$k-TAA scheme proposed by Emura et al., the experimental results show that our $k$k-TAA-PAYG scheme is 2.5 to 3 times faster and saves up to 66 percent storage in grant processes. The time cost of an authentication of our $k$k-TAA-PAYG scheme is constant (1.4-2.4 ms), while Emura et al.’s scheme needs more than one second when the number of access time is greater than 1, 000.",1941-0018,,10.1109/TDSC.2020.3007633,"Australian Research Council(grant numbers:ARC LP160101691); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3209012003C2,3209012001A1); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U19B2021); Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research(grant numbers:2019B030302008); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872152); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou(grant numbers:201902010081); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9134823,Cloud computing; $k$   k    -TAA; $k$   k    -times;anonymous;authentication;pay-as-you-go,Authentication;Cloud computing;Protocols;Pricing;Computational modeling;Quality of service,,,,3.0,,23.0,IEEE,7 Jul 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the early phase of cloud adoption, the price model was dominated by fixed prices. However, cloud market trend shows that dynamic pricing schemes utilization is being increased. In this plan, prices change according to demand in each cloud provider. In general, it is difficult for users to search cloud prices and decide where to put their resources. In this paper, we propose a scheduling model for optimizing virtual cluster placements across available cloud offers. This scheduler uses some variables such as average prices or cloud prices trends for suggesting an optimal deployment. Also, this scheduler is part of a cloud broker which automates actions and makes them transparent for users.

If we exclude the performance point of view where many previous studies highlight a non-negligible overhead induced by the virtualization layer at the heart of every Cloud middleware when running a HPC workload, the question of the real cost-effectiveness is often left aside with the intuition that, most probably, the instances offered by the Cloud providers are competitive from a cost point of view. In this article, we wanted to assert (or infirm) this intuition by analyzing what composes the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of an in-house HPC facility operated internally since 2007. This Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) model is then used to compare with the induced cost that would have been required to run the same platform (and the same workload) over a competitive Cloud IaaS offer. Our approach to address this price comparison is three-fold. First we propose a theoretical price-performance model based on the study of the actual Cloud instances proposed by one of the major Cloud IaaS actors: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). Then, based on the HPC facility TCO analysis we propose a hourly price comparison between our in-house cluster and the equivalent EC2 instances. Finally, based on the experimental benchmarking on the local cluster and on the Cloud instances we propose an update of the former theoretical price model to reflect the real system performance.

However, existing cloud pricing models and mechanisms are deterministic to some degree, thus, may not work well in a real-world environment where user perceived values with respect to cloud services are dynamically changing and highly personalized. In this article, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic cloud pricing scheme to optimize both cloud provider’s profit and costs of heterogeneous users with distinct personalities. Specifically, we first propose a novel personality-guided user perceived value prediction scheme to proactively capture the dynamics of the users’ perceived values with respect to cloud services. The prediction scheme models the relationship among user personality, service price, quality of service (QoS), user satisfaction and perceived value in the cloud service market. Second, on the basis of the prediction model, a RL-based cloud pricing mechanism is developed to learn sequential service pricing decision-making for profit and costs optimization. Particularly, the profit and costs optimization problem is modeled as a discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) that is solved by using Q-learning. Finally, extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to verify our user perceived value prediction scheme and RL-based cloud service pricing mechanism. Simulation results show that our perceived value prediction scheme can achieve up to 87.50 percent prediction accuracy, and our RL-based pricing mechanism can obtain up to 19.39 percent more profit than the state-of-the-art scheme.",2168-7161,,10.1109/TCC.2020.2992461,"National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB210130); ECNU Xinfuzhihua program; Dean's Fund and the Open Research Fund of Engineering Research Center of Software/Hardware Co-design Technology and Application; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802185,61872147); NSF of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20180470); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:30919011233); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086147,Cloud computing;pricing;user perceived value;personality;reinforcement learning;profit and cost optimization,Pricing;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Optimization;Biological system modeling;Quality of service,cloud computing;decision theory;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;pricing;profitability;quality of service;storage management,personality-guided cloud pricing;efficient commercial computing paradigm;cloud computing;storage resources;user perceived values;cloud services;reinforcement learning-based dynamic cloud pricing scheme;cloud provider;service price;user satisfaction;cloud service market;RL-based cloud pricing mechanism;sequential service pricing decision-making;cloud provider profit;cost optimization problem;Q-learning;RL-based cloud service pricing mechanism;personality-guided user perceived value prediction scheme;quality of service;discrete-time Markov decision process;extensive simulation experiments;efficiency 87.5 percent;efficiency 19.39 percent,,4.0,,73.0,IEEE,4 May 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cloud computing offers an elastic infrastructure that media content providers (e.g., VoD provider) can use to obtain resources on-demand. Since a media content provider is charged for amount of resources (bandwidth) rented from the cloud, an open problem is to decide on the right amount of resources allocated in the cloud and their reservation time such that the financial cost on the content provider is minimized. We consider a practical pricing model that is based on a non-linear tariff (i.e., a pricing scheme that depends non-linearly on the resources purchased or time reserved). We formulate the optimization problem based on prediction of future streaming demand. We then propose a simple (easy to implement) algorithm for resource allocation that exploits the non-linearity in the price contract, while ensuring that sufficient resources is reserved in the cloud without incurring wastage. The results of our numerical evaluation and simulations show that the proposed algorithm mimics the optimum solution very well.",2166-0077,978-1-4673-4941-3,10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477669,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477669,,Media;Bandwidth;Streaming media;Cloud computing;Prediction algorithms;Quality of service;Resource management,cloud computing;media streaming;optimisation;quality of service;resource allocation,prediction-based resource allocation;media streaming applications;Internet;cloud computing;media content provider;practical pricing model;nonlinear tariff;optimization problem;numerical evaluation;numerical simulations,,5.0,,11.0,IEEE,14 Mar 2013,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A key driver for bringing mobile networks into the cloud is the expected cost reduction resulting from economies of scale: all software run on commercial off-the-shelf server which can be accumulated in one or more datacenters with all of those having a similar setup, minimizing the administrative costs. Deploying mobile core control functions as applications in datacenters already proved to be viable and economic. However, the evolved packet core (EPC), which mostly comprises gateways, holds a special challenge, since there is a strong interaction between forwarding plane and control functions. Having those functions as application software running on servers in datacenters induces the risk that cost reductions from virtualization are offset by costs of additional transport and processing. This paper analyzes the total cost of ownership of several variants of virtualized EPC gateways for a country-scale mobile network covering Japan.

Currently cloud providers offer a wide range of services (machine sizes, availability modes, storage etc.) with complex pricing schemes (spot pricing, reservation pricing, etc.). At the same time, customers require distributed deployments in order to meet their own SLA commitments. This has led to the concept of multi-site multi-cloud deployment schemes that allows enterprises to deploy highly performant distributed applications such as gaming using multiple cloud providers. Existing research has solved the problem of cost optimization of such deployments BUT under the assumption of a single pricing scheme for all providers. The introduction of varied and dynamic pricing introduces several complexities that needs a fresh look at this problem. In this paper we present a solution for mapping the compute and storage requirements of a set of related enterprise sites onto cloud providers who offer multiple, dynamic pricing schemes. Our goal is to optimize the cost of a multi-site deployment consisting of compute and storage components at each site while meeting SLA requirements of the application. We show that our approach can achieve cost reductions of up to 22% for the customer even for medium sized deployments consisting of tens of sites over the scheme that uses either a single cloud provider or fixed pricing schemes.",2159-6190,978-1-4799-5063-8,10.1109/CLOUD.2014.97,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973803,,Pricing;Quality of service;Optimization;Complexity theory;Merging;Silicon;Cloud computing,cloud computing;optimisation,cost optimization;multisite multicloud environment;multiple pricing scheme;cloud computing;distributed application;dynamic pricing scheme;cost reduction,,12.0,,30.0,IEEE,4 Dec 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the proposed framework, customers distribute their workload between SC and VM to minimize their cost while maintaining a particular performance constraint, while the cloud provider sets SC and VM prices to maximize its profit. We explore the impact of relative prices, customer workload, service capacity, and provider costs. Our main result is the identification and characterization of three optimal operational regimes for both customers and the provider that leverage either SC or VM only, or both, in a hybrid configuration.

Our case studies demonstrate significant variations in the user costs, indicating significant unfairness among different users from the micro-economic perspective. Further studies reveal the reason for such variations is interference among concurrent virtual machines. The amount of interference cost depends on various factors, including workload characteristics, the number of concurrent VMs, and scheduling in the cloud. In this paper, we adopt the concept of pricing fairness from micro economics, and quantitatively analyze the impact of interference on the pricing fairness. To solve the unfairness caused by interference, we propose a pay-as-you-consume pricing scheme, which charges users according to their effective resource consumption excluding interference.

Cloud application management platforms hide the heterogeneity of the services and APIs, allowing, to varying degrees, portability between providers. These tools remove technical barriers to switching providers, but they do not provide a mechanism for evaluating the cost effectiveness of switching. This paper presents a decision support system, working within cloud application management platforms, that evaluates the costs of a customer's applications using resources from different cloud service providers.

As in many basic utilities, such as electricity and water, consumers/clients in cloud computing environments are charged based on their service usage, hence the term `pay-per-use'. While this pricing model is very appealing for both service providers and consumers, fluctuating service request volume and conflicting objectives (e.g., profit vs. response time) between providers and consumers hinder its effective application to cloud computing environments. In this paper, we address the problem of service request scheduling in cloud computing systems. We consider a three-tier cloud structure, which consists of infrastructure vendors, service providers and consumers, the latter two parties are particular interest to us. Clearly, scheduling strategies in this scenario should satisfy the objectives of both parties.

We claim that, in order to realize the full potential of cloud computing, the user must be presented with a pricing model that offers flexibility at the requirements level, such as a choice between different degrees of execution speed and the cloud provider must be presented with a programming model that offers flexibility at the execution level, such as a choice between different scheduling policies. In such a flexible framework, with each job, the user purchases a virtual computer with the desired speed and cost characteristics, and the cloud provider can optimize the utilization of resources across a stream of jobs from different users. We designed a flexible framework to test our hypothesis, which is called FlexPRICE (Flexible Provisioning of Resources in a Cloud Environment) and works as follows. A user presents a job to the cloud. The cloud finds different schedules to execute the job and presents a set of quotes to the user in terms of price and duration for the execution. The user then chooses a particular quote and the cloud is obliged to execute the job according to the chosen quote. FlexPRICE thus hides the complexity of the actual scheduling decisions from the user, but still provides enough flexibility to meet the users actual demands. We implemented FlexPRICE in a simulator called PRICES that allows us to experiment with our framework. We observe that FlexPRICE provides a wide range of execution options-from fast and expensive to slow and cheap-- for the whole spectrum of data-intensive and computation-intensive jobs.

However, predictability and trade-off of performance and cost are still key pitfalls for FaaS applications due to poor infrastructure transparency and lack of performance and cost models that fit the new paradigm. In this study, we therefore fill this gap by proposing formal performance and cost modeling and optimization algorithms, which enable accurate prediction and fine-grained control over the performance and cost of FaaS applications. The proposed model and algorithms provide better predictability and trade-off of performance and cost for FaaS applications, which help developers to make informed decisions on cost reduction, performance improvement, and configuration optimization.

Cloud computing is an essential component of the back bone of the Internet of Things (IoT). Clouds are needed to support huge numbers of interactions with varying quality requirements. Hence, Service quality will be a vital differentiator among cloud providers. In order to differentiate themselves from their competitors, cloud providers should offer best services that meet customers' expectations. A quality model can be used to represent, measure and compare the quality of the providers, such that a mutual understanding can be established among clouds take holders. With cloud as an additional deployment option, HPC users and providers faces the challenges of dealing with highly heterogeneous resources, where the variability spans across a wide range of processor configurations, interconnects, virtualization environments, and pricing models. HPC applications are increasingly being used in academia and laboratories for scientific research and in industries for business and analytics. Cloud computing offers the benefits of virtualization, elasticity of resources and elimination of cluster setup cost and time to HPC applications users.

Many of the current standalone cloud providers offer resources and services using pay-per-use fixed pricing. Spot pricing, recently introduced in Amazon EC2, is more efficient by setting the resource price dynamically, based on demand. However, this pricing scheme, similar to the uniform price auction, is truthful only when supply can be adjusted, such as the case of a standalone cloud provider. In a federated cloud, where resources from multiple cloud providers are integrated to increase elasticity and reliability, rational users can have a greater impact. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of rationality in a federated cloud, by comparing the consumer welfare achieved by spot pricing, currently used in Amazon EC2, and a strategy-proof pricing scheme. We consider different EC2 regions as providers in a federated cloud, and use traces of spot prices to determine the consumer requests and the user welfare.

With the advent of these bandwidth-intensive applications, it is economically inefficient to provide streaming distribution with guaranteed QoS relying only on central resources at a media content provider. Cloud computing offers an elastic infrastructure that media content providers (e.g., Video on Demand (VoD) providers) can use to obtain streaming resources that match the demand. Media content providers are charged for the amount of resources allocated (reserved) in the cloud. Most of the existing cloud providers employ a pricing model for the reserved resources that is based on non-linear time-discount tariffs (e.g., Amazon CloudFront and Amazon EC2). Such a pricing scheme offers discount rates depending non-linearly on the period of time during which the resources are reserved in the cloud. In this case, an open problem is to decide on both the right amount of resources reserved in the cloud, and their reservation time such that the financial cost on the media content provider is minimized. We propose a simple-easy to implement-algorithm for resource reservation that maximally exploits discounted rates offered in the tariffs, while ensuring that sufficient resources are reserved in the cloud. Based on the prediction of demand for streaming capacity, our algorithm is carefully designed to reduce the risk of making wrong resource allocation decisions.

Moreover, even if organizations scale up their IT infrastructure, these are hardly able to achieve the optimal utilization of the same. This has been a major hurdle in organizations decision to invest huge capital and resources for scaling up its operations. All this has forced companies to continuously look for innovative solutions in the form of new technological solutions that are easy as well as cost effective. One such technology that has come as a boon today is cloud computing. “Cloud computing” is a paradigm shift to provide computing over the internet.

This involves new feature developments for handling traffic with reduced latency to tackle routing scalability issues in a more secure way and to offer new services at cheaper cost. Considering the fact that prices of DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) or TCAM (Ternary Content-Addressable Memory) in legacy routers are not necessarily decreasing at a desired pace, cloud computing can be a great solution to manage the increasing computation and memory complexity of routing functions in a centralized manner with optimized expenses. Such cloud integration to routing is becoming plausible as cloud providers now offer various pricing schemes and provide large-scale computing infrastructure to meet the users' choice. Focusing on the attributes associated with existing routing cost models and by exploring a hybrid approach to SDN, we compare recent trends in cloud pricing (for both storage and service) to evaluate whether it would be economically beneficial to integrate cloud services with legacy routing for improved cost-efficiency.",1932-4537,,10.1109/TNSM.2019.2947030,"National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1647189,1321069); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8867898,Network economics;cloud computing;cloud pricing;SDN;routing;scalability,Cloud computing;Routing;Economics;Random access memory;Automobiles;Scalability;Biological system modeling,cloud computing;computer network management;content-addressable storage;DRAM chips;economics;Internet;pricing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;wide area networks,economic analysis;cloud-assisted routing;wider area SDN;Internet traffic;routing scalability issues;cloud computing;cloud integration;cloud pricing;legacy routing;improved cost-efficiency;dynamic random access memory;ternary content-addressable memory;DRAM;TCAM;routing cost models,,1.0,,70.0,IEEE,14 Oct 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Machine learning often involves big data sets and is computationally challenging, requiring efficient use of resources. The use of cloud computing as the platform for machine learning offers advantages of scalability and efficient use of hardware. It may, however, be difficult to provision appropriate cost-effective resources for a machine learning task. Our experiments have shown that there can be radical differences between different datasets and different algorithms on the same dataset. The cloud-based machine learning framework presented here aims to provide multiple levels of efficient use of resources and uses a high-level cost model to deal with overall cost-efficiency with respect to cloud service providers. The cost model allows evaluation of trade-offs and supports the choice of appropriate provider resources based on user-defined criteria. A user may choose to prioritize performance, prioritize cost or specify a cost-performance balance. An Amazon AWS cost model for instances is used to illustrate the practical benefits of using the approach - it is seen that large savings can be made by employing this job-specific monitoring and cost-performance analysis.

As for the cloud data center, the cost estimations will be made based on the servers' specifications analyzed from the data while comparing two cloud providers, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The calculations on the physical data center costs, the AWS cloud costs, and the Azure cloud cost are then compared to find which alternative has the least expenditures. It is found that alternative Microsoft Azure is the most affordable among others. However, interestingly, the highest cost among the three alternatives is the AWS cloud cost instead of the physical data center cost. Because of this, it is found that the cloud data center can be more affordable than the physical data center depending on the cloud provider that any company uses.

Our pricing model takes such factors into considerations as the amount of a service, the workload of an application environment, the configuration of a multiserver system, the service-level agreement, the satisfaction of a consumer, the quality of a service, the penalty of a low-quality service, the cost of renting, the cost of energy consumption, and a service provider's margin and profit.

This has been enabled by the high growth of EVs on roads; however, this may lead to a significant impact on the power grids. In order to keep EVs far from causing peaks in power demand and to manage building energy during the day, it is important to perform an intelligent scheduling for EVs charging and discharging service and buildings areas by including different metrics, such as real-time price and demand-supply curve. In this paper, we propose a real-time dynamic pricing model for EVs charging and discharging service and building energy management, in order to reduce the peak loads. Our proposed approach uses a decentralized cloud computing architecture based on software define networking (SDN) technology and network function virtualization (NFV). We aim to schedule user's requests in a real-time way and to supervise communications between microgrids controllers, SG and user entities (i.e., EVs, electric vehicles public supply stations, advance metering infrastructure, smart meters, etc.). We formulate the problem as a linear optimization problem for EV and a global optimization problem for all microgrids. We solve the problems by using different decentralized decision algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that proposes a pricing model based on decentralized Cloud-SDN architecture in order to solve all the aforementioned issues. The extensive simulations and comparisons with related works proved that our proposed pricing model optimizes the energy load during peak hours, maximizes EVs utility, and maintains the microgrid stability.

This model reflects the relationship between the user's resource costs and the budget costs. A multi-objective optimization scheduling method has been proposed based on this resource cost model. This method considers the makespan and the user's budget costs as constraints of the optimization problem, achieving multi-objective optimization of both performance and cost. An improved ant colony algorithm has been proposed to solve this problem. Two constraint functions were used to evaluate and provide feedback regarding the performance and budget cost. These two constraint functions made the algorithm adjust the quality of the solution in a timely manner based on feedback in order to achieve the optimal solution. Some simulation experiments were designed to evaluate this method's performance using four metrics: 1) the makespan; 2) cost; 3) deadline violation rate; and 4) resource utilization.

More and more applications are being deployed in cloud environments. Malware detection or antivirus software has been recently provided as a service in the cloud. A cloud antivirus provider hosts a number of virtual machines each running the same or different antivirus engines on potentially different sets of workloads (files). From the provider's perspective, the problem of optimally allocating physical resources to these virtual machines is crucial to the efficiency of the infrastructure. We propose a search-based optimization approach for solving the resource allocation problem in cloud-based antivirus deployments. An elaborate cost model of the file scanning process in antivirus programs is instrumental to the proposed approach. The general architecture is presented and discussed, and a preliminary experimental investigation into the antivirus cost model is described. The cost model depends on many factors, such as total file size, size of code segment, and count and type of embedded files within the executable. However, not a single parameter of these can be reliably used alone to predict file scanning time. Thus, a machine-learning approach that combines all these parameters as features is used to build a classifier for antivirus file scanning time. The best results we obtained were using the Decision Tree classifier. The highest F-measure value was 0.91, the highest F-measure value using logitboost was 0.87, the highest F-measure value using support vector machine was 0.85 and the highest F-measure value using naïve Bayes was 0.82. We evaluated the accuracy of the classification model versus linear regression model using the Root Mean Square (RMS) measure. We found that the classification model is more accurate than linear regression model, whereas the values average of RMS were 0.988 second and 2.44 second for classification model and linear regression model, respectively.",,978-977-403-695-8,10.1109/INFOS.2014.7036708,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036708,cloud Antivirus;Virtualization;Resource Allocation;Antivirus;Machine Learning;Cost Model,Decision support systems,Bayes methods;cloud computing;computer viruses;embedded systems;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;pattern classification;regression analysis;resource allocation;support vector machines;virtual machines;virtualisation,cloud antivirus cost model;machine learning;cloud computing;virtualization technology;cloud environment;malware detection;antivirus software;cloud antivirus provider;virtual machine;antivirus engine;physical resources allocation;search-based optimization approach;resource allocation problem;cloud-based antivirus deployment;file scanning process;antivirus program;code segment;embedded file;antivirus file scanning time;decision tree classifier;F-measure value;logitboost;support vector machine;naïve Bayes;classification model;linear regression model;root mean square measure;RMS measure,,,,21.0,,12 Feb 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the pay-as-you-go model, storage strategies and benchmarking approaches have been developed for cost-effectively storing large volume of generated application data sets in the cloud. However, they are either insufficiently cost-effective for the storage or impractical to be used at runtime. In this paper, toward achieving the minimum cost benchmark, we propose a novel highly cost-effective and practical storage strategy that can automatically decide whether a generated data set should be stored or not at runtime in the cloud. The main focus of this strategy is the local-optimization for the tradeoff between computation and storage, while secondarily also taking users' (optional) preferences on storage into consideration. Both theoretical analysis and simulations conducted on general (random) data sets as well as specific real world applications with Amazon's cost model show that the cost-effectiveness of our strategy is close to or even the same as the minimum cost benchmark, and the efficiency is very high for practical runtime utilization in the cloud.",1558-2183,,10.1109/TPDS.2013.20,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6410317,Data sets storage;computation-storage tradeoff;computation- and data-intensive applications;cloud computing,Benchmark testing;Computational modeling;Materials;Runtime;Delay;Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing,cloud computing;costing;storage management,highly practical approach;minimum data sets storage cost;cloud computing systems;computation power;storage capacity;pay-as-you-go model;storage strategy;benchmarking approach;minimum cost benchmark;local-optimization;Amazon cost model,,62.0,,32.0,IEEE,14 Jan 2013,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hybrid auto-scaling comprises of on-demand and spot instances pricing model for SWf computation under deadline and budget constraint. Many auto-scaling strategy have been proposed in the earlier works, but nevertheless, there is an ample scope for new auto-scaling strategy for efficient scheduling SWf in cloud environment. Moreover, hybrid auto-scaling approach for SWf considering spot and on-demand instances pose a challenge, since the approach has to estimate the proper amount and type of virtual machine instances to acquire and dynamically allocate the number of instances under spot or on-demand pricing model depending on the SWf need.

Ltd.; Independent researcher and cloud evangelist based out of Melbourne, Australia; International Institute of Information Technology-Bangalore, Bangalore, India",IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing,1 Sep 2017,2017.0,5.0,3,576,589,"In IT service delivery and support, the cloud paradigm has introduced the problem of resource over-provisioning through rapid automation (or orchestration) of manual IT operations. Due to the elastic nature of cloud computing, this shortcoming ends up significantly reducing the real benefit, viz., the cost-effectiveness of cloud adoption for Cloud Service Consumers (CSC). Similarly, detecting and eliminating such over-provisioning of cloud resources without affecting the quality of service (QoS) is extremely difficult for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) since they have visibility only into the state of the IT services (cloud resources) but none into the actual performance of business services. In this paper, we propose Tier-centric Business Impact and Cost Analysis (T-BICA), a tier-centric optimal resource allocation algorithm, to address the problem of rapid provisioning of IT resources in modern enterprise cloud environments, through extensive data gathering and performance analyses of business services in a simulated environment emulating a mature cloud service provider. We have derived improved analytics to address the issues and to accelerate real cloud adoption for large enterprises within the context of meeting (or exceeding) business service level objectives (SLOs) and minimizing the cloud subscription cost (OpEx) for the business. While investigating the problem, we consider the time and the cost of delivering business service in mediumto large-size enterprise environments, quantifying the negative impact of IT resource over-provisioning (due to highly mature IT services centric orchestration capabilities) on the business, and indicate how the suggested cloud analytics could assist in reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) of the business service. From our analysis of the test data, we have observed that our suggested approach and analytic reduces the cost of delivering business services by 65.19 percent, and improves the performance (total time to deliver) by 74.18 percent when compared to the existing modern cloud management and resource provisioning approach. Using T-BICA dramatically reduces upfront costs (CapEx) for CSPs (from the capacity procurement and management points of view) through efficient on-demand resource de-provisioning, without affecting business SLOs and IT service level agreements (SLAs). The improved dynamic allocation of resources also makes for better efficiency of utilization, which in turn has desirable consequences for sustainability, and makes this an approach for “Green” IT.",2168-7161,,10.1109/TCC.2015.2424888,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7090992,Cloud computing;infrastructure as a service;public cloud;private cloud;business impact analysis;business service;SLO;SLA;business applications;multi-tier system;over-provisioning;cloud service provider;cloud service consumer,Resource management;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Algorithm design and analysis;Organizations;Banking,cloud computing;resource allocation,tier-centric resource allocation;multitier cloud systems;cloud computing;cloud service consumers;CSP;tier-centric business impact and cost analysis;T-BICA;business service level objectives;SLO;cloud subscription cost;on-demand resource de-provisioning,,19.0,,48.0,IEEE,21 Apr 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This challenge is resolved to an extend by a very highly competitive service market. But from the provider's end, enabling any service incur cost and this expense need to be recovered and has to gain from the investment by defining the right pricing model.

Therefore, it was proposed to use the characteristics of the large load and high flexibility of the datacenters to respond to the demand response signal of the smart grid to maintain the stability of the power system. Specifically, this paper establishes a model that integrates multiple methods to precisely control the power consumption of the datacenter to minimize the total adjustment cost. First, according to the overall power consumption characteristics of the datacenter, the power consumption models of server and cooling system were established. Secondly, by controlling the temperature, different kinds of energy storage devices, load characteristics and server characteristics, the working process of various control methods and the corresponding operating cost model were obtained. Then, the operational cost and the adjustment penalty of each power regulation method were normalized to the total cost of datacenter. Finally, the proposed dynamic optimal scheduling method is used to achieve the goal of accurately adjusting the power consumption of the datacenter to minimize the total adjustment cost.

In a Cloud model, users are charged based on their usage of resources and the required quality of service (QoS) specifications. Although there are many existing workflow scheduling algorithms in traditional distributed or heterogeneous computing environments, they have difficulties in being directly applied to the Cloud environments since Cloud differs from traditional heterogeneous environments by its service-based resource managing method and pay-per-use pricing strategies. In this paper, we highlight such difficulties, and model the workflow scheduling problem which optimizes both makespan and cost as a Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP) for the Cloud environments. We propose an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO)-based algorithm to solve this workflow scheduling problem on an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform. Novel schemes for problem-specific encoding and population initialization, fitness evaluation and genetic operators are proposed in this algorithm. Extensive experiments on real world workflows and randomly generated workflows show that the schedules produced by our evolutionary algorithm present more stability on most of the workflows with the instance-based IaaS computing and pricing models. The results also show that our algorithm can achieve significantly better solutions than existing state-of-the-art QoS optimization scheduling algorithms in most cases. The conducted experiments are based on the on-demand instance types of Amazon EC2; however, the proposed algorithm are easy to be extended to the resources and pricing models of other IaaS services.",1558-2183,,10.1109/TPDS.2015.2446459,National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61272420); Provincial Science Foundation of Jiangsu(grant numbers:BK2011022); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7127017,Cloud computing;Infrastructure as a Service;multi-objective optimization;evolutionary algorithm;workflow scheduling;Cloud computing;infrastructure as a service;multi-objective optimization;evolutionary algorithm;workflow scheduling,Pricing;Schedules;Scheduling;Processor scheduling;Encoding;Quality of service;Computational modeling,cloud computing;evolutionary computation;quality of service;resource allocation;scheduling,evolutionary multiobjective workflow scheduling;cloud computing;computational resources;cloud model;QoS specification;quality-of-service specification;workflow scheduling algorithms;distributed computing environment;heterogeneous computing environment;cloud environments;service-based resource managing method;pay-per-use pricing strategies;multiobjective optimization problem;MOP;EMO-based algorithm;infrastructure as a service;IaaS platform;instance-based IaaS computing model;instance-based IaaS pricing model;Amazon EC2,,253.0,,43.0,IEEE,17 Jun 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under such a paradigm, a video service provider (VSP) can launch its own video streaming services virtually by renting the distribution infrastructure from one or more cloud service providers (CSPs). However, CSPs such as Amazon EC2 normally offer multiple pricing options for virtual machine (VM) instances that they can provide, such as on-demand instances, reserved instances, and spot instances. Such diverse pricing models make it challenging for a VSP to determine how to optimally procure the required number of VM instances in different types to satisfy dynamic user demands. Given the limited budget, a VSP needs to carefully balance the procurement cost and the achieved QoE for end users. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoff between the cost incurred by VM instance procurement and the achieved QoE of end users under Amazon EC2's pricing models, and formulate the VM instance provisioning and procurement problem into a constrained stochastic optimization problem. By applying the Lyapunov optimization framework, we design an online procurement algorithm, which approaches the optimal solution with explicitly provable upper bounds. We also conduct extensive trace-driven simulations and our results show that our proposed algorithm (OPT-ORS) achieves a good balance between the procurement cost and the user QoE for cloud-based VSPs. In the achieved near-optimal situation, our algorithm guarantees that reserved VM instances are fully utilized to satisfy the baseline user demand, on-demand VM instances are only rented to handle flash crowds, while more spot VM instances are rented than on-demand VM instances to serve user demand over the baseline due to their low prices.",1558-2205,,10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2283430,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6609069,Cloud computing;pricing model;video streaming,Streaming media;Pricing;Procurement;Resource management;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Optimization,cloud computing;electronic commerce;Lyapunov matrix equations;pricing;procurement;quality of experience;stochastic programming;telecommunication traffic;video streaming;virtual machines,cost-QoE tradeoff;cloud-based video streaming;Amazon EC2 pricing models;cloud computing;video stream delivery;quality-of-experience;video service provider;cloud service providers;distribution infrastructure;CSP;multiple pricing options;virtual machine;on-demand instances;reserved instances;spot instances;diverse pricing models;procurement cost balancing;VM instance provisioning problem;VM instance procurement problem;constrained stochastic optimization problem;Lyapunov optimization framework;online procurement algorithm;trace-driven simulations;OPT-ORS;cloud-based VSP;flash crowd handling;video traffic challenges,,59.0,,32.0,IEEE,25 Sep 2013,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher costs of cloud computing technology contribute to the volatility of the cloud and the financial instability of companies that depend on the cloud. Companies have their own unique cloud budget, and staying within that budget can become problematic in light of increasing costs. To save cost, many cloud users look to their cloud provider rather than looking at their own cloud purchases. A lack of studies on cloud users’ virtual machine (VM) workload and how cloud users spend money necessitates analysis of the spending of cloud customers. In this research paper, we analyzed a real-world data set from Microsoft Azure collected in 2019 that includes approximately 2.7 million VM traces. We developed a linear regression based pricing model to calculate the cost and used this model to analyze Microsoft Azure’s VM workload by comparing the cores, memory, lifetime, average utilization, and cost of each trace. By analyzing Microsoft’s data, we observed that users are not fully utilizing the cloud resources they have paid for. With this idea in mind, we then quantified the waste and developed an algorithm to determine which VMs are the most ineffective. We applied our algorithm to Microsoft Azure’s data set, and our results show that our algorithm discovered over one million wasteful VMs and helped 6,600 users save $3.3 million dollars. Even though cloud computing prices are increasing, cloud customers can save significantly by understanding VM workload better and selecting better-fitting VMs.",,978-1-6654-7232-6,10.1109/CECCC56460.2022.10069750,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10069750,VMs;cloud computing;cost;utilization;algorithm,Computers;Cloud computing;Analytical models;Costs;Linear regression;Companies;Pricing,cloud computing;pricing;regression analysis;virtual machines,cloud budget;cloud computing;cloud customers;cloud provider;cloud purchases;cloud resources;cloud users;cost companies;linear regression based pricing model;Microsoft Azure data set;Microsoft Azure VM workload;virtual machine workload;VM traces,,,,7.0,IEEE,16 Mar 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, an increasing number of Low Latency Applications (LLAs) notably in the entertainment, IoT, and automative domains require response times much smaller than the supported ones by the typical “client-to-cloud” network model. Cloudlets have been introduced as “data centres in a box”, for bringing computing resources “closer” to the end users. As a result, LLAs can take advantage of cloudlets to improve their Quality-of-Service (QoS) by reducing the underlying response times between their users and application instances' location. In this work, we study the emerging market of stateful LLAs' provisioning over geo-distributed third-party cloudlets. We assume that cloudlets offer their resources in the form of Virtual Machines (VMs) via collocated markets. Forwarding requests for LLAs interact with cloudlet markets for performing on-path and on-demand resource provisioning. We introduce a pricing scheme where users pay a fixed price for each time unit of their engagement to an LLA instance.

Existing pricing schemes, however, either provide no service guarantees (e.g., Spot Instances in Amazon EC2), or use static on-demand pricing in which the price cannot respond quickly to market dynamics (e.g., On-demand Instances in Amazon EC2). To overcome these problems, in this paper we design dynamic auctions where computing instances are periodically auctioned off to accommodate user demands over time. We address the two main challenges of revenue maximization and auction truthfulness. Our design encompasses a capacity allocation scheme, which determines the amount of instances to be auctioned off in each period, as well as the underlying auction mechanisms, based on dynamic payment schemes corresponding to the proposed capacity allocations over time. We show that our design is two-dimensionally truthful, and it is asymptotically optimal when demand is sufficiently high. Furthermore, by identifying certain optimization structures, we substantially reduce the computational complexity of our solution.

Users of these systems are rational and maximize their own interest when consuming and contributing shared resources, even if by doing so they affect the overall efficiency of the system. To manage rational users, resource pricing and allocation can provide the necessary incentives for users to behave such that the overall efficiency can be maximized. In this paper, we propose a dynamic pricing mechanism for the allocation of shared resources, and evaluate its performance. In contrast with several existing trading models, our scheme is designed to allocate a request with multiple resource types, such that the user does not have to aggregate different resource types manually.

The services offered by a cloud service provider are limited by provider-specific options in terms of the pre-specified configurations. Moreover, it is sometimes expensive to pay a fixed amount of money without any format of negotiation or price-matching deals for the cloud-based services and resources. Conversely, the negotiator-based model for opaque services has gained popularity in various markets, such as, for flights, hotels, and rentals. We posit that a similar opaque inventory for cloud-based services and resources is the next generation niche for consumer acquisition and service delivery in the cloud computing market. Such a model will facilitate the clients with flexible resource and service provisioning at reasonable prices, and will also allow a higher revenue and increase resource utilization for cloud service providers.

The Litigo component acts as a middle-man to deliver cloud-based services from a set of cloud service providers to the end users. We present a detailed cost model and comparison between establishing a cloud service vs. an opaque cloud service. Our empirical framework allows a Litigo service provider to analyze the profit model and creates the market niche accordingly.

This flexibility potentially allows clients of cloud computing solutions to reduce the total cost of ownership of their Information Technology infrastructures. On the other hand, this market-based model is not the only way to reduce costs. Among other solutions proposed, peer-to-peer (P2P) grid computing has been suggested as a way to enable a simpler economy for the trading of idle resources. In this paper, we consider an IT infrastructure which benefits from both of these strategies. In such a hybrid infrastructure, computing power can be obtained from in-house dedicated resources, from resources acquired from cloud computing providers, and from resources received as donations from a P2P grid. We take a business-driven approach to the problem and try to maximise the profit that can be achieved by running applications in this hybrid infrastructure. The execution of applications yields utility, while costs may be incurred when resources are used to run the applications, or even when they sit idle. We assume that resources made available from cloud computing providers can be either reserved in advance, or bought on-demand. We study the impact that long-term contracts established with the cloud computing providers have on the profit achieved. Anticipating the optimal contracts is not possible due to the many uncertainties in the system, which stem from the prediction error on the workload demand, the lack of guarantees on the quality of service of the P2P grid, and fluctuations in the future prices of on-demand resources. However, we show that the judicious planning of long term contracts can lead to profits close to those given by an optimal contract set. In particular, we model the planning problem as an optimisation problem and show that the planning performed by solving this optimization problem is robust to the inherent uncertainties of the system, producing profits that for some scenarios can be more than double those achieved by following some common rule-of-thumb approaches to choosing reservation contracts.",1573-0077,978-1-4244-9221-3,10.1109/INM.2011.5990678,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990678,,Computational modeling;Robustness;Measurement,cloud computing;contracts;grid computing;optimisation;peer-to-peer computing;quality of service,long-term contracts;management;hybrid IT infrastructure;cloud computing;information technology;peer-to-peer grid computing;business-driven approach;quality of service;planning problem;optimisation problem,,2.0,,14.0,IEEE,18 Aug 2011,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rapid deployment, high scalability, on-demand, and (theoretically) infinite resources have driven the industry towards the wide adoption of cloud computing services. However, the difficulty of cross-provider resource allocation and seamless resource transition is a major concern for such services. Therefore, the segregated cloud market forces its clients to use provider-specific and pre-configured options for their required resources and services. Thus, the overall market, even with the presence of multiple cloud service providers, operates as a direct service from the providers to the clients, and with non-negotiable pricing strategies for the cloud services.

In this paper, we propose an approach to enable secure data processing on the Cloud with the data from different organizations. The approach consists of a data federation platform for secure data processing on the Cloud named FedCube and a greedy data placement algorithm that creates a plan to store data on the Cloud in order to achieve multiple objectives based on a cost model. The cost model is composed of two objectives, i.e., reducing both monetary cost and execution time.

One of its delivery models, called infrastructure as a service (IaaS), provides users with infrastructure services such as computation and data storage, heavily dependent upon virtualization techniques that offers benefits such as elasticity and cost efficiency. Most of current IaaS service providers have adopted a user-based service model, where users are directly mapped to virtualized resources that they want to use and they are charged based on usage. Hence, user and resource management are centralized and easily administered at the IaaS provider. However, this also results in the lack of support for scalable management of users and resources, organization-level security policy, let alone flexible pricing model. Considering the increasing popularity of cloud computing, there is a strong need for a more scalable and flexible IaaS model, along with a more fine grained access control mechanism. In this paper we propose a domain-based framework for provisioning and managing users and virtualized resources in IaaS to address this issue. Specifically, an additional layer called domain is introduced to the user-based service model, and the domain layer facilitates the de-centralization of user and virtualized resource management in IaaS. The cloud service provider is able to delegate its administrative works to domains, and domains manage their users and virtualized resources allocated from the cloud service provider.

Shortly, renting more nodes to improve the performance of cloud computing is not cost-efficient in a pay-as-you-go environment. In this research, we propose the concept of ""Cost-Efficient Awareness"" to emphasize the importance of cost-efficiencies on the development of cloud economy. To realize this concept, we have derived a cost improvement process within the MapReduce programming model to cooperate with cloud instance provision. We view this cost improvement process as a discrete optimization problem for cloud instance provision under the premise of economic constraint. When we scale up the service, it is critical to keep the costs down. The concept of ""Cost-efficient Awareness"" just reflects such a consideration.

Cloud computing provides a pay-as-you go model where the consumer pays only for the used resources. In such an environment, resource provisioning plays a major role in minimizing the consumers cost. For efficient resource provisioning various algorithms and techniques based on linear programming are applied.

Taking advantage of this pricing scheme, customers can implement auto-scaling purchase policies by leasing (e.g., hourly) necessary amounts of resources to satisfy a desired QoS threshold under their current demand. Auto-scaling yields strict QoS and variable charges. Some customers, however, would be willing to settle for a more relaxed statistical QoS in exchange for a predictable flat charge. In this work we propose Temporal Rate Limiting (TRL), a purchase policy that permits a customer to allocate optimally a specified purchase budget over a predefined period of time. TRL offers the same expected QoS with auto-scaling but at a lower, flat charge. It also outperforms in terms of QoS a naive flat charge policy that splits the available budget uniformly in time.

Montero,"Department Computer Architecture, Universite Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain",2012 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS),16 Aug 2012,2012.0,,,573,573,"Nowadays, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds are considered a viable solution for the on-demand provisioning of computational resources. Since its popularization in 2006 by the Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2), the IaaS paradigm is being adopted by many organizations not only to lease resources from a Cloud provider, but also to implement on-premise IaaS Clouds. The former, and original usage, is usually referred as Public Clouds while the latter is commonly named Private Cloud. Public as well as private clouds have rapidly evolved since the advent of the IaaS cloud paradigm. The public IaaS market has been enriched with multiple providers each one with different price model and offers, Cloud interfaces and APIs and even a disparate features. The private ecosystem is not different and multiple technologies both open-source and private can be used today to build on-premise clouds. Again the features, characteristics and adoption levels greatly vary among these technologies. In this talk we will review the main characteristic of the IaaS model for resource provisioning. In particular, we will analyze one of the key components to fulfill this view, the Virtual Resource management system or Cloud OS. The Cloud OS manages the physical and virtual infrastructures, and commands and controls the service provisioning, by orchestrating the deployment of virtual resources. This analysis is performed using OpenNebula as a paradigmatic example. In particular, the presentation will analyze the challenges of managing compute, storage and networking resources in a distributed environment; present the VM management model adopted by OpenNebula; and study the operation of OpenNebula in clouds environments. Finally, the talk will include the description of the Hybrid Cloud computing model, a paradigm that combines on-premise private clouds with the resources of public clouds.

For the first eight years of spot, pure market dynamics and high pricing variability created an ideal environment for time-series prediction. Following a pricing-scheme change in 2017, this extreme variability was removed as pricing is artificially smoothed for the end-user, therefore making it significantly easier to accurately predict prices. Nevertheless, the literature demonstrates ongoing efforts to accurately predict spot prices. To show prediction in the modern spot market is unnecessary, we train nearly 2.2 million ARIMA models on new and old data to demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy for models trained on new data. Further, we show this new ease of price prediction makes spot instances ideal for large-scale, cost-aware cloud computing, as cost estimation is now trivial.

This paper introduces a new cloud brokerage service to help web service providers to minimize their cloud computing cost for deadline-constrained batch jobs, which have been a significant workload in web services. Our cloud brokerage service associates each batch job with deadline, and always tries to use cheaper reserved instances for computation to maintain a minimum cost. We achieve this with the following two steps: (1) given a set of jobs' specifications, determine the scheduling of jobs, (2) given the scheduling and pricing options, find an optimal instance renting strategy. We prove that both problems in two steps are computation intractable, and propose approximation algorithms for them.

In order to reduce the total cost for data, given cloud service providers with different pricing models on their resources, users can flexibly choose a cloud service to store a generated dataset, or delete it and choose a cloud service to regenerate it whenever reused. However, finding the minimum cost is a complicated yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that can calculate the minimum cost for storing and regenerating datasets in clouds, i.e., whether datasets should be stored or deleted, and furthermore where to store or to regenerate whenever they are reused. This minimum cost also achieves the best trade-off among computation, storage and bandwidth costs in multiple clouds.

However, due to fluctuations in the workload of services and applications, making a cost-efficient VM configuration decision in the cloud remains a critical challenge. Even experienced administrators cannot accurately predict the workload in the future. Since the pricing model of cloud provider is convex other than linear that often assumed in past research, instead of typical scaling out strategy. In this paper, we adopt mix scale strategy. Based on this observation, we model an optimization problem aiming to minimize the VM configuration cost under the constraint of migration delay. Taking advantages of Lyapunov optimization techniques, we propose a mix scale online algorithm which achieves more cost-efficiency than that of scale out strategy. Experimental results shows that the mix scale algorithm saves 30.8% and 31.1% cost where controlling migration delay in a tolerable range under different workload respectively.",1938-1883,978-1-4673-8999-0,10.1109/ICC.2017.7997241,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997241,,,cloud computing;Lyapunov methods;optimisation;pricing;virtual machines,VM configuration algorithm;mix scaling strategy;pay-per-use pricing model;cloud computing;Lyapunov optimization,,2.0,,17.0,IEEE,31 Jul 2017,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data federation brings new opportunities to the data-related cooperation among organizations by providing abstract data interfaces. With the development of cloud computing, organizations store data on the cloud to achieve elasticity and scalability for data processing. The existing data placement approaches generally only consider one aspect, which is either execution time or monetary cost, and do not consider data partitioning for hard constraints. In this paper, we propose an approach to enable data processing on the cloud with the data from different organizations. The approach consists of a data federation platform named FedCube and a Lyapunov-based data placement algorithm. FedCube enables data processing on the cloud. We use the data placement algorithm to create a plan in order to partition and store data on the cloud so as to achieve multiple objectives while satisfying the constraints based on a multi-objective cost model.

To solve the two subproblems, we propose an online approximation algorithm with a provable competitive ratio for the particular scenario with no latency requirements.

As more and more workloads are created on the cloud or migrated to the cloud for economic and flexibility reasons, it is important for developers, users, and service providers alike to understand the challenges, opportunities, complexities, and benefits of building dependable systems and applications on the cloud. In this tutorial, we give participants first-hand experience in protecting and recovering against large-scale cloud outages, e.g., failure of an entire cloud site. The tutorial is organized as a full-day activity and is designed to be hands-on. The content is targeted towards a broad audience of users, developers, practitioners, and researchers in the area of cloud computing. The content level is beginner-to-intermediate, suited for anyone with an undergraduate background in computer science (or equivalent) and basic programming skills. In the theory part of the tutorial, we introduce terminology, concepts, and metrics for providing resiliency on a cloud platform. We catalog factors that make building resilient applications on the cloud easy in some cases and particularly complicated in other cases. We present a reference architecture and a standard set of use cases for resiliency on the cloud. The bulk of the tutorial focuses on educating the audience with a series of hands-on exercises. We use an example set of cloud requirements as the starting point, and then guide the participants through the process of creating a protection and recovery plan. The plan covers details such as how to prioritize different workloads based on their criticality during recovery, what protection and recovery technologies should be used, and whether they should be used at the server level or application level. During the hands-on exercises, participants form teams or work individually to access a pre-created cloud virtual infrastructure and applications hosted on the IBM Softlayer cloud [2], which is geographically distributed across multiple continents. Replication and recovery orchestration form the backbone of many cloud resiliency solutions. We guide the participants through the entire life cycle of a cloud resiliency solution: 1) activation of protection on a set of workloads, 2) recovery of protected workloads upon a large-scale outage, 3) failback of protected workloads from the recovery site to the original site upon restoration of the original site, and 4) test of the implemented protection and recovery solution to ensure the implementation conforms to the requirements. Using a real-world orchestration technology, participants activate protection against outages at multiple levels of the cloud stack, orchestrate recovery procedure for a simulated site-level outage, and orchestrate failback to the primary cloud site (simulating the reconstruction of that site). We perform exercises for protecting and recovering both servers and applications using different types of replication technologies. The hands-on exercises are tailored to enable audience members to gain a strong grasp of the practical challenges involved in cloud resiliency, e.g., determining recovery priorities based on business criticality, recovery groups, and coordinated recovery across multiple virtual machines constituting a business application. Through the exercises, we reinforce core design principles and design elements for building resilient cloud applications. We expose the participants to a wide range of protection and recovery options for achieving resiliency against site-level cloud outages. Cloud users can use this experience to make more informed decisions on protecting their workloads against large-scale failures. After the hands-on exercises, we conclude with a survey of commercial and academic solutions, emerging areas, and future research challenges in the area of cloud resiliency.",,978-1-5090-3688-2,10.1109/DSN-W.2016.55,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7575393,,Cloud computing;Tutorials;Buildings;Servers;NIST;Conferences,cloud computing;data protection,cloud computing;pay-as-you-go pricing models;large-scale cloud outage;computer science;programming skills;recovery technology;protection technology;cloud virtual infrastructure;IBM Softlayer cloud;recovery orchestration;cloud resiliency solution;real-world orchestration technology;multiple virtual machines;site-level cloud outages,,,1.0,2.0,IEEE,3 Oct 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pay-as-you-go model allows users to be charged only for services they use. Current purchasing designs, however, are still primitive with significant constraints. Spot Instance, the first deployed auction-style pricing model of Amazon EC2, fails to enforce fair competition among users in facing of resource scarcity and may thus lead to untruthful bidding and unfair resource allocation. Dishonest users are able to abuse the system and obtain (at least) short-term advantages by deliberately setting large maximum price bids while being charged only at lower Spot Prices. Meanwhile, this may also prevent the demands of honest users from being satisfied due to resource scarcity. Furthermore, Spot Instance is inefficient and may not adequately meet users' overall demands because it limits users to bid for each computing instance individually instead of multiple different instances at a time. In this paper, we formulate and investigate the problem of cloud resource pricing. We propose a suite of computationally efficient and truthful auction-style pricing mechanisms, which enable users to fairly compete for resources and cloud providers to increase their overall revenue. We analytically show that the proposed algorithms can achieve truthfulness without collusion or (t, p)-truthfulness tolerating a collusion group of size t with probability at least p. We also show that the two proposed algorithms have polynomial complexities O(nm + n2) and O(nm), respectively, when n users compete for m different computing instances with multiple units.

Cloud computing services are offered by providers and can be classified into three modalities: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). In IaaS, the providers offer services divided into instances. With this, the user has a virtual machine at their disposal with the computational resources desired at a given cost. The main challenge faced by companies is to choose what is the best pricing plan (instance/provider) to supply their computational demand. Frequently, these companies need a large computational infrastructure to manage and improve their business processes and, due to the high cost of maintaining local infrastructure, they have begun to migrate applications to the cloud. This work aims to provide insights that can help companies in selection process of the best provider/instance to deploy and execute integrations solutions in the cloud.

One such issue is vendor lock-in, forcing the Cloud users to adhere to one service provider in terms of data and application logic. Semantic Web has been an important research area that has seen significant attention from both academic and industrial researchers. One key property of Semantic Web is the notion of interoperability and portability through high level models. Significant work has been done in the areas of data modeling, matching, and transformations.

However, choosing and configuring an appropriate cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), e.g., the appropriate database and computing instances and acceptable service rates, is a daunting task. The task is also challenging when trying to optimize the IaaS for conflicting objectives such as performance and cost. Furthermore, due to lack of understanding of the pricing model and the cloud IaaS, a cloud consumer may pay more than necessary or may not fully utilize the purchased resources. For this reason, we propose an algorithm that suggests the most cost-effective configuration meeting the QoS requirements and budget constraint. In contrast to existing cost optimization proposals, our proposed algorithm maps the minimum requirements of the to- be-deployed web application to deployment costs according to the price model set by cloud providers. The algorithm also considers QoS requirements for different resource types in the cloud, namely, database servers, computing servers, storage, and service rate. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by a series of experiments on a web application with seven different workload scenarios.

Farokhi,"Institute of Information Systems, Vienna University of Technology, Austria","2014 14th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing",8 Jul 2014,2014.0,,,591,594,"Cloud computing popularity is growing rapidly and consequently the number of companies offering their services in the form of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is increasing. The diversity and usage benefits of the IaaS offers are encouraging SaaS providers to lease resources from the Cloud instead of operating their own data centers. This helps them to get rid of the maintenance overheads and better satisfy their customers which are more demanding in terms of service requirements nowadays. Such evolutionary tendency is leading to the emergence of new ways of service provisioning in which relying on infrastructure services of a single Cloud provider is not sufficient. Namely, the need of using Cloud services from multiple Clouds with various quality attributes and pricing models has been raised recently. Although service allocation based on Service Level Agreement (SLA) has been well investigated in Cloud computing so far, the new upcoming issues regarding to utilize multiple Clouds has led to new challenges. This paper looks at the service selection and allocation in a Multi-Cloud, as a delivery model of multiple Clouds, from the perspective of SaaS provider.

The model constructs a tree structure, referred to as the execution dependency tree (EDT), to accurately represent various execution relations, or dependencies (e.g., sequential, parallel and conditional branching) among the application modules, along its different execution paths. Contrary to existing models that assume fixed average offloading costs, each module's cost is modelled as a random variable described by its Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) that is statistically estimated through application profiling. Using this model, we generalize the offloading cost optimization functions to those that use more user tailored statistical measures such as cost percentiles. We employ these functions to propose an efficient offloading algorithm based on a dynamic programming formulation. We also show that the proposed model can be used as an efficient tool for application analysis by developers to gain insights on the applications' statistical performance under varying network conditions and users behaviours. Performance evaluation results show that the achieved mean absolute percentage error between the model-based estimated cost and the measured one for the application execution time can be as small as 5 percent for applications with sequential and branching module dependencies.",2168-7161,,10.1109/TCC.2015.2513404,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368898,Cloud computing;application modeling;offloading;statistical application cost model;execution path;cumulative distribution functions,Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Partitioning algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Object oriented modeling,cloud computing;costing;dynamic programming;mobile computing;performance evaluation;resource allocation;statistical analysis;statistical distributions,Cumulative Distribution Function;application profiling;tree structure;offloading algorithm;application offloading;statistical cost model;execution dependency tree;cloud computing resources;cost optimization functions;dynamic programming;performance evaluation;mobile application execution,,12.0,,41.0,IEEE,30 Dec 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aiming at provisioning flexible on-demand mobile-edge cloud service, in this paper we propose a comprehensive framework consisting of a resource-efficient computation offloading mechanism for users and a joint communication and computation (JCC) resource allocation mechanism for network operator. Specifically, we first study the resource-efficient computation offloading problem for a user, in order to reduce user's resource occupation by determining its optimal communication and computation resource profile with minimum resource occupation and meanwhile satisfying the QoS constraint.

We show the admission control problem is NP-hard, and hence develop an efficient approximation solution of a low complexity by carefully designing the user ranking criteria and rigourously derive its performance guarantee. To prevent the manipulation that some users may untruthfully report their valuations in acquiring mobile-edge cloud service, we further resort to the powerful tool of critical value approach to design truthful pricing scheme for JCC resource allocation.

To address this limitation, we propose a suite of mechanisms that enhances cloud computing technologies with more assurance capabilities. Assurance becomes a measurable property, quantified by the volume of evidence to audit and retain in a privacy-preserving and nonrepudiable fashion. By proactively collecting potential forensic evidence, the cloud becomes more accountable, while providing its regular services.

Thus, it is a challenge for a video service provider to determine the optimal number of virtual machines under multiple pricing model while maintaining quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we propose a cloud-based VoD system model and investigate the resource provisioning problem under the QoS constraint which is defined as overload probability.

Many organizations are attracted to cloud computing as an ICT (information and communications technology) sourcing model that can improve flexibility and total cost of ICT systems. However, it can be difficult for a prospective cloud customer to determine and manage cloud usage costs. We present an overview of several NICTA research projects that aim at providing information that can help ICT professionals determine various cloud usage costs and make decisions that are appropriate from the business viewpoint. Before migrating an application into a cloud, it is necessary to choose to which cloud to migrate, because there is a huge variety of cloud offerings, with significantly different pricing models. To accurately capture projected operating costs of an application in a particular cloud and enable side-by-side comparison of cloud offerings from different providers, NICTA developed a cost estimation tool that calculates the costs based on usage patterns and other characteristics of the application. This tool can also be used during runtime as an input into making adaptation/control decisions. To collect various runtime metrics (e.g., about the amount of transferred data or received quality of service - QoS) that are necessary for operational management and assessment of cloud usage costs, NICTA developed an innovative tool for flexible and integrated monitoring of applications in clouds and (in case of hybrid clouds) related local data centers. To help determine which runtime adaptation/control decisions are best from the business viewpoint (e.g., incur lowest cost), we extended the WS-Policy4MASC language and MiniZnMASC middleware for autonomic business-driven IT management with events and adaptation actions relevant for cloud management.

However, the uncertainty of variable loads necessitate the use of margins - servers that must be held active to absorb unpredictable potential load bursts - which can be a significant fraction of overall cost. Further, naively switching to an on-demand cloud model can actually degrade true costs (server costs that would be incurred even if margin costs disappeared) because of the fundamental economic rule wherein on-demand services/goods cost more compared to reserved services/goods where the user bears some commitment. On-demand customers pay a premium in exchange for not undertaking the fixed-cost risk that committed customers undertake. This paper addresses the twin challenges of minimizing margin costs and true costs in an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud. Our paper makes the following two contributions. First, rather than use a fixed margin, we observe that the margin may be selectively used depending on load levels. Based on the above observation, we develop ShrinkWrap-opt which is a dynamic programming algorithm that achieves optimal margin cost while satisfying the desired (statistical) response time guarantees. Second, we propose commitment straddling - the selective use of some reserved machines in conjunction with on-demand machines - to achieve optimal true-cost. Simulations with real Web server load traces using the Amazon EC2 cost model reveal that our techniques save between 13% and 29% (21% on average) in cost while satisfying response-time targets.",,978-1-4673-1146-5,10.1109/ISPASS.2012.6189210,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189210,,Servers;Nickel;Load modeling;Time factors;Dynamic programming;Vectors;Equations,cloud computing;cost reduction;dynamic programming,selective commitment;selective margin;cost minimization;IaaS cloud;infrastructure-as-a-service;cloud computing;elastically scaling computation potential;peak demand provision;load burst;on-demand cloud model;margin cost;server cost;on-demand customer;fixed-cost risk;ShrinkWrap;dynamic programming algorithm;Web server load trace;Amazon EC2 cost model;response-time target,,9.0,2.0,17.0,IEEE,26 Apr 2012,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, each deployed cache has an associated cost. As the request rate from a region varies (e.g., according to a daily cycle), there may be periods when the request rate is high enough to justify this cost, and other periods when it is not. Cloud computing offers a solution to problems of this kind, by supporting the dynamic allocation and release of resources. In this paper, we analyze the potential benefits from dynamically instantiating caches using resources from cloud service providers. We develop novel analytic caching models that accommodate time-varying request rates, transient behavior as a cache fills following instantiation, and selective cache insertion policies. Using these models, within the context of a simple cost model, we then develop bounds and compare policies with optimized parameter selections to obtain insights into key cost/performance tradeoffs.

The development of cyber foraging concept allows the users to offload the computationally intensive services to the nearest data centers for getting instant results. The Internet WAN latency acts as a major constraint to get instant results for computationally intensive services. The development of cloudlets in recent years allows the cloud users to offload computationally intensive operations to cloudlets to get the results, where the cloudlets get connected with users through LAN or Wi-Fi. The cloudlets are generally deployed based on the geographical area and density of users. Cloud brokers act as an intermediate layer between the cloud and the users.

Typically, the granularity of usage for such pricing is at virtual machine (VM) level in IaaS clouds, e.g., a multiple of machine hours. The elasticity and cost effectiveness in these clouds are primarily achieved through the exploitation of resource virtualization and sharing. However, a majority of applications running on VMs in clouds struggle to fully utilize resources allocated to them. Since co-location granularity is strictly restricted to VM level and resources allocated to VMs are space-shared, the unused resources are apt to be wasted while users are still charged for such wastage. In this paper, we address the problem of fine-grained and adaptive resource sharing for real pay-per-use pricing. To this end, we devise a resource management mechanism as a cost efficiency solution for both users and providers of clouds. The mechanism consists of a container-based resource allocator and a real-usage based pricing scheme. We demonstrate the efficacy of this mechanism via experiments, in Amazon EC2, using two typical workloads in clouds, web services and database services, and a compute-intensive high energy physics application. Our results show that the mechanism can achieve near-optimal cost efficiency.",,978-1-4673-9566-3,10.1109/ICCAC.2015.36,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312164,Cloud computing;fine-grained resource sharing;containerization;pay-per-use pricing,Resource management;Pricing;Web servers;Databases;Electronic mail;Physics,cloud computing;pricing;resource allocation;virtual machines;virtualisation,fine-grained resource sharing;adaptive resource sharing;real pay-per-use pricing;cloud computing;elasticity;virtual machine;VM;IaaS clouds;cost effectiveness;resource virtualization;resource allocation;colocation granularity;resource management mechanism;container-based resource allocator;real-usage based pricing scheme;Amazon EC2;Web services;database services;high energy physics application,,2.0,,25.0,IEEE,29 Oct 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Workflow scheduling is one of the most challenging problems in cloud computing. Although, workflow scheduling on distributed systems like grids and clusters have been extensively studied, however, these solutions are not viable for a cloud environment. It is because, a cloud environment differs from other distributed environment in two major ways: on-demand resource provisioning and pay-as-you-go pricing model. Thus, to achieve the true benefits of workflow orchestration onto cloud resources novel approaches that can capitalize the advantages and address the challenges specific to a cloud environment needs to be developed. This work proposes a dynamic cost-effective deadline-constrained heuristic algorithm for scheduling a scientific workflow in a public cloud. The proposed technique aims to exploit the advantages offered by cloud computing while taking into account the virtual machine (VM) performance variability and instance acquisition delay to identify a just-in-time schedule of a deadline constrained scientific workflow at lesser costs.

A central mechanism called scaling or auto-scaling is responsible for adjusting the allocated resources dynamically to current or predicted demands. Most of today's solutions support short-term optimization, where the long-term effect of scaling actions is not considered, therefore the overall operational cost can be sub-optimal. In this paper, we address this issue and provide a long and short-term scaling optimization method called LSSO. Our contribution is threefold. First, we introduce the formal description of the LSSO scaling problem motivated by real cloud native applications. Second, we transform the problem into a tractable graph representation and show that the optimal solution of the original problem emerges as a shortest path problem in the graph. As a result, the transformation and the optimal solution can be computed in polynomial time. Third, we evaluate and validate the proposed algorithm by numerical analysis on multiple datasets using a cost model which considers the running and scaling costs. Results suggest that if the dynamics of the traffic is fairly predictable and the scaling cost is not negligible, LSSO is able to reduce the operation costs significantly. The exact cost gain depends on the ratio of the running and scaling costs, but in realistic operation regimes it can reach even 18 % and the method can also tolerate some inaccuracies in the forecast.",,978-1-6654-7334-7,10.1109/NFV-SDN56302.2022.9974612,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9974612,cloud computing;scaling optimization,Shortest path problem;Costs;Heuristic algorithms;Software algorithms;Optimization methods;Transforms;Predictive models,cloud computing;graph theory;optimisation;resource allocation,allocated resources;auto-scaling;cloud environments;cloud native applications;current predicted demands;demand forecast-based resource allocation;exact cost gain;long term scaling optimization method;long-term effect;LSSO scaling problem;network service management;operation costs;operational cost;optimal solution;resource cost optimization;running scaling costs;scaling actions;short-term optimization;short-term scaling optimization method;short-term scaling optimizer;shortest path problem,,,,23.0,IEEE,16 Dec 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many organizations are therefore considering using a combination of a secure internal cloud, along with (what they perceive to be) less secure public clouds. However, this raises the issue of how to partition applications across a set of clouds, while meeting security requirements. Currently, this is usually done on an ad-hoc basis, which is potentially error prone, or for simplicity the whole application is deployed on a single cloud, so removing the possible performance and availability benefits of exploiting multiple clouds within a single application. This paper describes an alternative to ad-hoc approaches a method that determines all ways in which applications structured as workflows can be partitioned over the set of available clouds such that security requirements are met. The approach is based on a Multi-Level Security model that extends Bell-LaPadula to encompass cloud computing. This includes introducing workflow transformations that are needed where data is communicated between clouds. In specific cases these transformations can result in security breaches, but the paper describes how these can be detected. Once a set of valid options has been generated, a cost model is used to rank them.

The proliferation of resource properties and pricing plans has made the selection, procurement and management of cloud resources a time-consuming and complex task, which stands to benefit from automation. This contribution focuses on the procurement decision of reserved contracts in the context of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers such as Amazon EC2. Such reserved contracts complement pay-by-the-hour pricing models, and offer a significant reduction in price (up to 70%) for a particular period in return for an upfront payment. Thus, customers can reduce costs by predicting and analyzing their future needs in terms of the number and type of server instances. We present an algorithm that uses load prediction with automated time series forecasting based on a Double-seasonal Holt-Winters model, in order to make cost-efficient purchasing decisions among a wide range of contract types while taking into account an organization's current contract portfolio. We analyze its cost effectiveness through simulation of real-world web traffic traces. Our analysis investigates the impact of different prediction techniques on cost compared to a clairvoyant predictor and compares the algorithm's performance with a stationary contract renewal approach. Our results show that the algorithm is able to significantly reduce IaaS resource costs through automated reserved contract procurement.

However, it also incurs new privacy and security problems, as data is under a centralized third-party instead of the data owner’s direct control. Existing data markets are also questioned on their inflexible and opaque pricing, where the value of data ownership and the cost of query searches are mixed. In this paper, we consider blockchain-based storage as a better choice to ensure safe data outsourcing since data is spread out across many data points. We propose an Ethereum-based data market that provides distributed storage and correct remote data search. We design a new pricing model, where each query will be charged by two parties: owner (paid for providing his data) and miner (rewarded by performing query searches). We study a new cooperative search scheme through a proxy to reduce cost on the user side. Given that each user query is charged based on its number of keywords, then a cooperative search can reduce user-side cost by combining multiple queries into a group so that overlapped keywords will only be charged for one time. To ensure user QoE, a combined query should not be significantly larger than any of its original queries in terms of the number of keywords. The total price is based on the total number of keywords in all groups. Since it is a cooperative model with shared resources, we also study various incentive properties on the user side, yielding a cost sharing mechanism to split joint cost in a truth-revealing and fair manner. We further extend our market with a set of substitute data owners and propose a double auction mechanism to match users and owners based on their requirements.

While High Performance Computing (HPC) centers continuously evolve to provide more computing power to their users, several voices (most probably commercial ones) emit the wish that CC platforms could also serve HPC needs and eventually replace in-house HPC platforms. If we exclude the pure performance point of view where many previous studies highlight a non-negligible overhead induced by the virtualization layer at the heart of every Cloud middleware when submitted to an High Performance Computing (HPC) workload, the question of the real cost-effectiveness is often left aside with the intuition that, most probably, the instances offered by the Cloud providers are competitive from a cost point of view. In this article, we wanted to assert (or infirm) this intuition by evaluating the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of the in-house HPC facility we operate since 2007 within the University of Luxembourg (UL), and compare it with the investment that would have been required to run the same platform (and the same workload) over a competitive Cloud IaaS offer. Our approach to address this price comparison is two-fold. First we propose a theoretical price - performance model based on the study of the actual Cloud instances proposed by one of the major Cloud IaaS actors: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). Then, based on our own cluster TCO and taking into account all the Operating Expense (OPEX), we propose a hourly price comparison between our in-house cluster and the equivalent EC2 instances.

Some features of cloud, such as low cost, scalability, robustness and availability are attracting large-scale industries as well as small businesses towards cloud. A virtual machine (VM) is a software that can run its own operating system and applications just like an operating system on a physical computer. As the number of users increases, allocation of resources and scheduling become a complex task in a cloud. In a federated cloud environment when resource requirements of user requests exceed resource limits of cloud provider, to fulfil the requests the cloud provider can out-source to other cloud providers' resources. Under these circumstances it is desirable to minimize the Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. This can be achieved through load balancing. This paper proposes a load balancing algorithm that is threshold based. We consider two types of pricing models for VMs, on-demand and reserved.

Companies hosting cloud computing services face the challenge of handling data intensive applications. Semantic web technologies can be an ideal candidate to be used together with cloud computing tools to provide a solution. These technologies have been standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). One such standard is the Resource Description Framework (RDF). With the explosion of semantic web technologies, large RDF graphs are common place. Current frameworks do not scale for large RDF graphs. In this paper, we describe a framework that we built using Hadoop, a popular open source framework for Cloud Computing, to store and retrieve large numbers of RDF triples. We describe a scheme to store RDF data in Hadoop Distributed File System.

Cloud services are typically hosted in a set of geographically distributed data centers, which we will call the cloud infrastructure. To minimize the total cost of ownership of this cloud infrastructure (which accounts for both the upfront capital cost and the operational cost of the infrastructure resources), the infrastructure owners/operators must do a careful planning of data center locations in the targeted service area (for example the US territories), data center capacity provisioning (i.e., the total CPU cycles per second that can be provided in each data center). In addition, they must have flow control policies that will distribute the incoming user requests to the available resources in the cloud infrastructure. This paper presents an approach for solving the unified problem of data center placement and provisioning, and request flow control in one shot. The solution technique is based on mathematical programming. Experimental results, using Google cluster data and placement/provisioning of up to eight data center sites demonstrate the cost savings of the proposed problem formulation and solution approach.",1558-1101,978-3-9815370-2-4,10.7873/DATE.2014.292,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800493,,Servers;Power demand;Electricity;Routing;Cities and towns;Cloud computing;Resource management,cloud computing;computer centres;mathematical programming,concurrent placement;request flow control;distributed cloud infrastructure;data center locations;data center capacity provisioning;total CPU cycles per second;data center placement;mathematical programming;Google cluster data;cloud computing,,,,20.0,,21 Apr 2014,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clouds poses as an opportunity for scientists that need high performance computing infrastructure to execute their scientific experiments. Most of the experiments modeled as scientific workflows manage the execution of several activities and work with large amounts of data. In this way parallel techniques are often a key factor. Parallelizing a scientific workflow in the cloud environment is not trivial. One of the complex tasks is to define the number and types of virtual machines and to design the parallel execution strategy. Due to the number of options for configuring an environment it is a hard task to do it manually and it may produce negative impact on performance. This paper initially proposes a cost model based on concepts of quality of service (QoS) in clouds to help determining an adequate configuration of the environment according to restrictions imposed by scientists.,2378-3818,978-1-4577-0879-4,10.1109/SERVICES.2011.52,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6012716,Scientific Workflows;Cloud Computing,Quality of service;Virtual machining;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Equations;Cloud computing;Computer architecture,cloud computing;parallel processing;quality of service;scheduling;virtual machines;workflow management software,cost model;scientific workflows scheduling;cloud environment;cloud computing;distributed resource;high performance computing infrastructure;parallel technique;virtual machine;parallel execution strategy;quality of service,,11.0,,10.0,IEEE,8 Sep 2011,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this analysis, we use a brawny heterogeneous Amazon EC2 cloud instance with GPU and two wimpy heterogeneous systems represented by Jetson TK1 and Jetson TX1. As the paradigm shift to edge computing is due to the challenges of Big Data processing, we select six representative MapReduce applications with applicability in IoT edge computing. Using our time-energy-cost analysis of both wimpy edge compute nodes and cloud computing systems with GPUs, we present several key insights. Firstly, we advocate the usage of heterogeneous systems with GPU on both edge and cloud since they provide time-energy savings of up to 70% for compute-intensive applications. Secondly, we establish an equivalence ratio between one brawny cloud instance and multiple wimpy edge nodes that achieve the same or better time performance. Based on this equivalence ratio, we show that using wimpy systems as edge computing devices saves cost compared to using traditional cloud computing. Lastly, counter-to-intuition, our analysis shows that the latest Jetson TX1 system exhibits worse time-cost performance compared to the older Jetson TK1 system. This result stems from lower operating core clock frequency and lower instructions-per-cycle of Jetson TX1's GPU on some compute-intensive applications.",,978-1-5386-2017-5,10.1109/IEEE.EDGE.2017.10,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029250,edge computing;cloud computing;heterogeneous systems;GPU;brawny;wimpy;time performance;energy;cost performance,Edge computing;Cloud computing;Graphics processing units;Computer architecture;Performance evaluation;Java,Big Data;cloud computing;energy conservation;graphics processing units;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;power aware computing,wimpy heterogeneous systems;time-energy-cost analysis;wimpy edge computing;wimpy edge compute nodes;time-energy savings;brawny heterogeneous Amazon EC2 cloud;IoT;Jetson TX1 system;Jetson TK1 system;Big Data processing;MapReduce;GPU,,13.0,1.0,32.0,IEEE,11 Sep 2017,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diverse pricing schemes among different IaaS service providers or even in the same provider form a complex economic landscape that nurtures the market of cloud brokers. By strategically scheduling multiple customers' resource requests, a cloud broker can fully take advantage of the discounts offered by cloud service providers.

In this research we consider the problem of managing a computing infrastructure whose processing elements are acquired from infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) providers, and used to support the execution of long-lived on-line transactions processing applications, whose workloads experience huge fluctuations over time, such as Web applications. Resources can be acquired from IaaS providers in different ways, each with its own pricing scheme and associated quality of service. One acquisition model allows resources to be reserved for long periods of usage at a reduced usage price, while others allow dedicated resources to be instantiated on demand at any time, subject to the availability of resources, with a usage price that is usually larger than that paid for reserved resources. In this context, the problem that we address in this paper is how the provider of a Web application should plan the long-term reservation contracts with an IaaS provider, in such a way that its profitability is increased. We propose a model that can be used for guiding this capacity planning activity. We use the model to evaluate the gains that can be achieved with the judicious planning of the infrastructure capacity in a number of scenarios. We show that the gains can be substantial, specially when the load variation between normal operational periods and surge periods is large.",,978-1-4244-6534-7,10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470726,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470726,,Capacity planning;Disaster management;Cloud computing;Costs;Information technology;Assembly;Technology management;Fluctuations;Pricing;Quality of service,Internet;Web services,business-driven capacity planning;cloud-based IT infrastructure;Web applications;information technology;cloud computing paradigm;infrastructure-as-a-service;usage price;acquisition model,,15.0,,27.0,IEEE,24 May 2010,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, each deployed cache has an associated cost, and under time-varying request rates (e.g., a daily cycle) there may be long periods when the request rate from the local region is not high enough to justify this cost. Cloud computing offers a solution to problems of this kind, by supporting dynamic allocation and release of resources. In this article, we analyze the potential benefits from dynamically instantiating caches using resources from cloud service providers. We develop novel analytic caching models that accommodate time-varying request rates, transient behavior as a cache fills following instantiation, and selective cache insertion policies. Within the context of a simple cost model, we then develop bounds and compare policies with optimized parameter selections to obtain insights into key cost/performance tradeoffs. We find that dynamic cache instantiation can provide substantial cost reductions, that potential reductions strongly dependent on the object popularity skew, and that selective cache insertion can be even more beneficial in this context than with conventional edge caches.

In contrast to traditional on-premise computing environments, where the number of resources is bounded, cloud computing can provide practically unlimited resources to a workflow application based on a pay-as-you-go pricing model. One challenge of using cloud computing is the protection of the privacy of the confidential workflow's tasks, whose proprietary algorithm implementations are intellectual properties of the respective stakeholders. Another one is the monetary cost optimization of executing workflows in the cloud while satisfying a user-defined deadline. In this paper, we use the Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) as a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to support the confidentiality of individual workflow tasks. Based on this, we propose a deadline-constrained and SGX-aware workflow scheduling algorithm, called SEED (SGX, Efficient, Effective, Deadline Constrained), to address these two challenges. SEED features several heuristics, including exploiting the longest critical paths and reuse of extra times in existing virtual machine instances. Our experiments show that SEED outperforms the representative algorithm, IC-PCP, in most cases in monetary cost while satisfying the given user-defined deadline.

While fog computing satisfies the real-time processing need of delay-sensitive IoT applications by bringing virtualized resources closer to the farm, cloud computing allows the execution of applications with higher computational requirements. The deployment of IoT applications is a critical challenge as cloud and fog nodes vary in terms of their resource availability, security status, and cost models. Moreover, diversity in resources, quality of service (QoS), and security requirements of IoT applications make the problem even more complex.

Cloud computing, which provides practically unlimited computing and storage resources, has enabled a new generation of data-centric workflows, called big data workflows. New big data workflow scheduling algorithms should optimally utilize the characteristics of cloud computing such as heterogeneous virtual machines, the elastic resource provisioning model, and the pay-as-you-go pricing model, as well as the time and monetary cost to transfer large amounts of data. In this paper, we consider one case of the general big data workflow scheduling problem where a deadline, δ, is given for a workflow, W, and the goal is to minimize the monetary cost of running W in the cloud while satisfying the given deadline, δ. To this end, we leverage the power of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) in order to search for the best solution within a reasonable planning time. More specifically, we introduce an innovative fitness function that combines the time and monetary cost of a workflow in one metric. Based on the EA and the fitness function, we design a deadline-constrained big data workflow scheduling algorithm, called iCATS (Improved Cultural Algorithms-based Task Scheduling).

Many applications need to interact with several heterogeneous data stores depending on the type of data they have to manage: relational and NoSQL (i.e., document, graph, key-value, and column) data stores. Interacting with heterogeneous data models via different APIs and query languages imposes challenging tasks to the developers of multiple data stores applications. Indeed, the execution of complex queries over heterogeneous data models cannot, currently, be achieved in a declarative way as it is used to be with single data store application, and therefore requires extra implementation efforts. In this paper we propose a mediation based component to optimize and execute complex queries over multiple data stores in Cloud environments. This component is referred to as virtual data store (VDS).

The location of users, service composers, service providers, and data providers will affect the total cost of service provision.

However, auto-scaling in most Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) systems is based on reactive, threshold-driven approaches. Such systems are incapable of catering to rapidly varying workloads, unless the associated thresholds are sufficiently low. Alternatively, maintaining low thresholds leads to resource over-provisioning under relatively stable workloads. Moreover, thresholds are not a good indication of QoS compliance, which is a key performance indicator of a cloud application. Hence, it is nontrivial to determine an optimum threshold while minimizing costs and meeting QoS demands. We propose inteliScaler, a proactive and cost-aware auto-scaling solution to address these issues by combining a predictive model, cost model, and a smart killing feature.

Multi-tier pricing schemes are widely adopted by cloud service providers (CSPs) to charge cloud users for inter-datacenter transmission services. To avoid a severe penalty associated with missing a deadline, cloud users are prone to selecting a sufficiently high service level. However, they are usually unaware of the total traffic volume before accessing the network; hence, a high transmission cost is introduced. In this paper, we propose an online cost-efficient transmission scheme for cloud users with information-agnostic traffic. The basic idea is to split a long-term transmission request into a series of short-term ones. In this scheme, we take into account the CSP’s countermeasures, and model the interactions between the cloud users and the CSP as a Stackelberg game. We show that the optimal number of short-term requests and the associated transmission service levels can be determined with an online algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization. The experimental results reveal that the CSP and the cloud users can achieve a win-win outcome, whereby the transmission cost of cloud users can be reduced by 59 percent.",2168-7161,,10.1109/TCC.2019.2941688,"National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1004700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1701263); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1836214); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702365,61672379,61772112); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City(grant numbers:17JCQNJC00700,17ZXRGGX00150,18ZXZNGX00040); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8839825,Inter-datacenter transmission;information-agnostic traffic;stackelberg game;lyapunov optimization,Cloud computing;Bandwidth;Pricing;Routing;Games;Optimization;Time factors,cloud computing;computer centres;computer networks;optimisation;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication traffic,inter-datacenter networks;cloud computing;network services;geographically distributed cloud platforms;inter-datacenter traffic;multitier pricing schemes;cloud service providers;cloud users;inter-datacenter transmission services;high transmission cost;online cost-efficient transmission scheme;information-agnostic traffic;long-term transmission request;associated transmission service levels,,1.0,,38.0,IEEE,16 Sep 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heterogeneous cloud service providers may join the cloud systems to serve various types of users. Cloud services can be complementary or substitutable. For the complementary services, users may request for a bundle of the services, e.g., CPU and storage, to gain higher benefit from requesting them alone. The substitutable services have similar functionalities to serve users, e.g., different cloud database services, obtaining one of them can replace another one. Furthermore, the users of the cloud systems also influence each other because of externalities, particularly, network effect and congestion effect. From the perspective of each user, the existence of other users may introduce positive or negative impacts on the user utility, in the case of network and congestion effects, respectively. In this work, the participants in the cloud systems are treated as social enabled rational individuals. We model the complementarity, substitutability and externalities in cloud services by employing a multiple-leader multiple- follower Stackelberg game approach, including a two-stage service transaction process where service providers and users make their transaction decisions in a distributed manner.

As cloud can be accessed anytime and anywhere through commodity hardware only its demand is increasing day by day. So it must provide high performance gain to the user and at the same time must be beneficial for the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). To achieve this goal many challenges have to be faced. Load balancing is one of them which helps the CSP to meet the QoS requirements of the users and at the same time maximize his profit by optimum use of the resources. To balance the load in cloud the resources and workloads must be scheduled in an efficient manner. A variety of scheduling algorithms are used by load balancers to determine which backend server to send a request to. The selected server allocates resources and schedules the job dynamically on some virtual machine (VM) located on the same physical machine. It is also the responsibility of the provider to dynamically reallocate or migrate the VM across physical machines for workload consolidation and to avoid over utilization or under utilization of resources. In this paper, we have discussed different algorithms proposed to resolve the issue of load balancing and task scheduling in Cloud Computing. We have mentioned some of their shortcomings for further development.

The proposed new fog computing model with clear functional modules is able to mitigate the potential problems of dedicated computing infrastructure and slow response in cloud computing. We run analytics benchmark experiments over fogs formed by Rapsberry Pi computers with a distributed computing engine to measure computing performance of various analytics tasks, and create easy-to-use workload models. Quality of services (QoS) aware admission control, offloading, and resource allocation schemes are designed to support data analytics services, and maximize analytics service utilities. Availability and cost models of networking and computing resources are taken into account in QoS scheme design. A scalable system level simulator is developed to evaluate the fog-based analytics service and the QoS management schemes. Experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of analytics services over multitier fogs and the effectiveness of the proposed QoS schemes. Fogs can largely improve the performance of smart city analytics services than cloud only model in terms of job blocking probability and service utility.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2017.2724845,EU FP7 Project DETERMINE(grant numbers:FP7-PEOPLE-2012-IRSES 318906); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7972945,Data analytics;fog computing;Internet of Things (IoT);quality of services (QoS);Raspberry Pi;smart cities;Spark,Edge computing;Computational modeling;Cloud computing;Smart cities;Quality of service;Data analysis;Analytical models,cloud computing;data analysis;Internet of Things;quality of service;resource allocation;smart cities,ad-hoc fogs;opportunistic computing resources;dedicated computing resources;fog computing model;dedicated computing infrastructure;cloud computing;Rapsberry Pi computers;distributed computing engine;data analytics services;analytics service utilities;networking computing resources;smart city analytics services;cloud only model;multitier fog computing;large-scale IoT data analytics;large-scale data analytics service;smart cities applications,,165.0,,15.0,IEEE,11 Jul 2017,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different service models are employed in CC including the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model, in which the costumers request a certain set of resources and the cloud service providers provide these resources in the form of a virtual machine (VM) running on one of the thousands of hosting servers or physical machines (PMs) of a data center. Where to ""place"" VMs, how to ""execute"" them and whether there is a need to ""move/migrate"" them are important decisions that affect the overall resource utilization and power consumption in the hosting data center.

Proper scheduling of the tasks of a workflow in the Cloud is a challenging area of research, especially if the workflow is deadline-sensitive. Moreover, the users want the Cloud services at a low monetary cost. Hence, the scheduling approach must be cost-effective. Cloud service providers like Amazon offer virtual machine (VM) instances through different pricing models- on-demand, reserved, and spot. The spot VMs are generally available at a much lower price than the on-demand VMs. However, spot VMs are unreliable. We propose a scheduling algorithm for deadline-sensitive workflows in a heterogeneous Cloud environment using the on-demand and spot instances. Our algorithm reduces the resource renting cost while ensuring that the workflow gets completed within its deadline. It also provides tolerance against premature termination of the spot instances.

End-users are increasingly sensitive to the latency of services they consume. Service Developers want the Service Providers to ensure or provide the capability to dynamically allocate and manage resources in response to changing demand patterns in real-time. Ultimately, Service Providers are under pressure to architect their infrastructure to enable real-time end-to-end visibility and dynamic resource management with fine grained control to reduce total cost of ownership while also improving agility. The current approaches to enabling real-time, dynamic infrastructure are inadequate, expensive and not scalable to support consumer mass-market requirements. Over time, the server-centric infrastructure management systems have evolved to become a complex tangle of layered systems designed to automate systems administration functions that are knowledge and labor intensive. This expensive and non-real time paradigm is ill suited for a world where customers are demanding communication, collaboration and commerce at the speed of light. Thanks to hardware assisted virtualization, and the resulting decoupling of infrastructure and application management, it is now possible to provide dynamic visibility and control of services management to meet the rapidly growing demand for cloud-based services. What is needed is a rethinking of the underlying operating system and management infrastructure to accommodate the ongoing transformation of the data center from the traditional server-centric architecture model to a cloud or network-centric model. This paper proposes and describes a reference model for a network-centric datacenter infrastructure management stack that borrows and applies key concepts that have enabled dynamism, scalability, reliability and security in the telecom industry, to the computing industry. Finally, the paper will describe a proof-of-concept system that was implemented to demonstrate how dynamic resource management can be implemented to enable real-time service assurance for network centric datacenter architecture.2010",1524-4547,978-1-4244-7217-8,10.1109/WETICE.2010.14,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541982,Cloud Computing;Distributed Computing;Virtualization;Data Center,Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Resource management;Computer networks;Computer network management;Communication industry;Computer industry;Delay;Automatic control;Pressure control,computer architecture;computer centres;Internet;network servers;resource allocation,next generation cloud computing architecture;storage resources;networking resources;service developers;service providers;dynamic resource management;consumer mass market requirements;server centric infrastructure management systems;systems administration function automation;hardware assisted virtualization;cloud based services;operating system;data center;network centric data center infrastructure management;telecom industry;computing industry;proof-of-concept system;real-time service assurance;shared distributed physical infrastructure,,49.0,4.0,7.0,IEEE,5 Aug 2010,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The economy of scale promise of cloud computing is a great opportunity to approach this problem, by developing elastic large scale server infrastructures. However, a proactive approach to dynamic resource provisioning requires prediction models forecasting future load patterns. On the other hand, unexpected volume and data spikes require reactive provisioning for serving unexpected surges in workloads. When workload can not be predicted, adequate data grouping and placement algorithms may facilitate agile scaling up and down of an infrastructure. In this paper, we analyze a dynamic workload of an on-line music portal and present an elastic Web infrastructure that adapts to workload variations by dynamically scaling up and down servers. The workload is predicted by an autoregressive model capturing trends and seasonal patterns. Further, for enhancing data locality, we propose a predictive data grouping based on the history of content access of a user community. Finally, in order to facilitate agile elasticity, we present a data placement based on workload and access pattern prediction.

This paper proposes a technique that uses machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, and Long Short Term Memory) to forecast 24-hour of available resources at the host level. Our technique relies on the use of quantile regression to provide a flexible trade-off between the potential amount of resources to reclaim and the risk of SLA violations. In addition, several metrics (e.g., CPU, RAM, disk, network) were predicted to provide exhaustive availability guarantees. Our methodology was evaluated by relying on four in production data center traces and our results show that quantile regression is relevant to reclaim unused resources.

Given the rise of application containers both in the cloud computing and High Performance Computing (HPC) scenarios, it becomes more and more important to measure power consumption also at the application level, where power-aware schedulers and orchestrators can optimize the execution of the workloads not only from a performance perspective, but also considering performance/power trade-offs.

When the workload demand is given, the data center operators desire minimizing their TCO. On the other hand, when the workload demand is unknown while the requirements on quality of experience (QoE) of the Internet services are given, the data center operators need to determine the appropriate amount of resources and design redirection strategies in presence of multiple data centers to guarantee the QoE. For the first problem, we present formulations to minimize server energy consumption and server cost with dynamic temporal demand and propose novel aggregation methods to reduce computational complexity.

Optimal partitioning will allow mobile devices to obtain the highest benefit from Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) or Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). Due to unstable resources in the wireless network (network disconnection, bandwidth fluctuation, network latency, etc.) and at the service nodes (different speeds of mobile devices and cloud/edge servers, memory, etc.), static partitioning solutions with fixed bandwidth and speed assumptions are unsuitable for offloading systems. In this paper, we study how to dynamically partition a given application effectively into local and remote parts while reducing the total cost to the degree possible. For general tasks (represented in arbitrary topological consumption graphs), we propose a Min-Cost Offloading Partitioning (MCOP) algorithm that aims at finding the optimal partitioning plan (i.e., to determine which portions of the application must run on the mobile device and which portions on cloud/edge servers) under different cost models and mobile environments.

Because the competition is an extremely important factor in the marketplace, the cost model for data-intensive service provision is the key to provide a sustainable service market. As data play the dominant role in execution of data-intensive service composition, the cost and access response time of data sets influence the quality of the service that requires the data sets.

Usually, in Cloud markets, contracts between traders are established using Service Level Agreements (SLAs), which include objectives of service usage. However, Cloud markets face challenges, which are usually not evident in other market types, such as non-standardized goods and large variety of resource types offered on the market, resulting in low number of matches of consumers' bids and providers' asks. Moreover, existing Cloud market mechanisms are usually static and cannot react on dynamic change of user requirements. To counteract these problems, we propose an adaptive approach for autonomically deriving public SLA templates (i.e., templates for generation of electronic contracts) based on user requirements. Although this approach brings many benefits, it also incurs cost to users, since they must adapt specifications of their requirements in order to match automatically generated public SLA templates. In this paper, we reduce this cost by autonomically modifying specifications of user requirements. We introduce a method for adapting public SLA templates not only in respect to definitions of SLA attributes, but also to attribute values.

To provide Internet application service by using cloud resource, a service provider needs to consider the resource subscription cost and Service Level Agreement (SLA) of its users. Several kinds of pricing model of cloud resource subscription have been proposed. In such case, the Internet service provider plays the role of a cloud customer with a need of optimal cloud resource subscription policy to reduce its operation cost. Therefore, how to determine a suitable policy of cloud resource subscription has become a challenging issue. In this work, we proposed a two-phase approach to solve the cloud resource subscription problem. The first phase considered long-term resource reservation. In this phase, we proposed a mathematic model to compute an upper bound of the optimal amount of long-term reserved resource. The second phase was dynamic resource subscription phase. In order to overcome dynamic resource demand, in this phase, we used Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to predict resource demand and allocate VM resource adaptively based on the prediction.

Many business peoples are getting attracted towards cloud computing model because of the features easy to manage, device independent, location independent. But this cloud models comes with many security issues. A business person keeps crucial information on cloud, so security of data is crucial issue as probability of hacking and unauthorised access is there. Also availability is a major concern on cloud. This paper, discusses the file distribution and SHA-1 technique. When file is distributed then data is also segregated into many servers. So here the need of data security arises. Every block of file contains its own hash code, using hash code which will enhance user authentication process, only authorized person can access the data. Here, the data is encrypted using advanced encryption standard, so data is successfully and securely stored on cloud. Third party auditor is used for public auditing. This paper discusses the handling of some security issues like Fast error localization, data integrity, data security.

Previously, a main concern of Internet applications developers was deployment and hosting of applications, because it required acquisition of a server with a fixed capacity able to handle the expected application peak demand and the installation and maintenance of the whole software infrastructure of the platform supporting the application. Furthermore, server was underutilized because peak traffic happens only at specific times. With the advent of the Cloud, deployment and hosting became cheaper and easier with the use of pay-peruse flexible elastic infrastructure services offered by Cloud providers. Because several Cloud providers are available, each one offering different pricing models and located in different geographic regions, a new concern of application developers is selecting providers and data center locations for applications. However, there is a lack of tools that enable developers to evaluate requirements of large-scale Cloud applications in terms of geographic distribution of both computing servers and user workloads. To fill this gap in tools for evaluation and modeling of Cloud environments and applications, we propose CloudAnalyst.

To fill this gap, this paper presents Cloudstep, a step-by-step decision process aimed at supporting legacy application migration to the cloud. The process relies on the creation of template-based profiles characterizing the organization, the target legacy application and candidate cloud providers, which are then cross-analyzed to help identify and possibly resolve critical constraints (either technical or non technical) that may hinder migration to the cloud.

Prior works proposed various algorithms to reduce energy cost or to improve RUtR, which either lack the fine-grained task scheduling capabilities, or fail to take a comprehensive system model into consideration. This article presents H2O-Cloud, a Hierarchical and Hybrid Online task scheduling framework for warehouse-scale Cloud service providers, to improve resource usage effectiveness while maintaining QoS. H2O-Cloud is highly scalable and considers comprehensive information, such as various workload scenarios, cloud platform configurations, user request information, and dynamic pricing model.

Factors such as dynamic network conditions, concurrent user access, and limited resource availability, cause offloading decisions that negatively impact overall processing throughput and end-user delays. Moreover, edge/cloud platforms currently offer both Virtual Machine (VM) and serverless computing pricing models, but many existing edge offloading approaches only investigate single VM-based offloading performance. In this paper, we propose a predictive (NP-complete) scheduling-based offloading framework and a heuristic-based counterpart that use machine learning to dynamically decide what combinations of functions or single VM needs to be deployed so that tasks can be efficiently scheduled. We collected over 10,000 network and device traces in a series of realistic experiments relating to a protest crowds incident management application. We then evaluated the practicality of our predictive cyber foraging approach using trace-driven simulations for up to 1000 devices. Our results indicate that predicting single VM offloading costs: (a) leads to near-optimal scheduling in 70% of the cases for service function chaining, and (b) offers a 40% gain in performance over traditional baseline estimation techniques that rely on simple statistics for estimations in the case of single VM-offloading.

RE steps include requirement elicitation, requirement analysis, requirement specification and requirement validation. Data is collected by semi-structured interview from the providers and the users of cloud services in 11 Thai government organizations, and from cloud service provider for meeting enterprise requirements and user requirements. The results reveal nine key issues that affect cloud project delivery: (1) lack of trust with external cloud service provider by generation X and baby boomer (2) lack of transparency as regards the legal agreement about the cloud user's personal data protection responsibility by cloud service provider, (3) the issues of reliability, security and service level agreements (4) lack of knowledge and lack of understanding of cloud technology (5) required training and a learning by doing (6) the policy to use government cloud services instead of developing their own cloud, (7) older people at top-level tend to resist cloud technology, (8) people in general lack of knowledge and understanding of cloud technology (9) problems about pricing model, it's impact on 23 cloud requirements (functional and non-functional) as well as factors that involved in RE phases.

Edge computing has the promise of bringing cloud resources to the network edge to augment the capability of mobile devices in close proximity to the user. One big challenge in edge computing is the efficient allocation and adaptation of edge resources in the presence of high dynamics imposed by user mobility. This paper provides a formal study of this problem. By characterizing a variety of static and dynamic performance measures with a comprehensive cost model, we formulate the online edge resource allocation problem with a mixed nonlinear optimization problem. We propose MOERA, a mobility-agnostic online algorithm based on the “regularization” technique, which can be used to decompose the problem into separate subproblems with regularized objective functions and solve them using convex programming. Through rigorous analysis we are able to prove that MOERA can guarantee a parameterized competitive ratio, without requiring any a priori knowledge on input. We carry out extensive experiments with various real-world data and show that MOERA can achieve an empirical competitive ratio of less than 1.2, reduces the total cost by $4 \times$4× compared to static approaches, and outperforms the online greedy one-shot solution by 70 percent. Moreover, we verify that even being future-agnostic, MOERA can achieve comparable performance to approaches with perfect partial future knowledge.

Fog servers act as an intermediate layer between cloud datacenters and end-user devices and provide compute, storage, and networking services between these devices and traditional clouds. An important consideration is the dynamic determination of the optimal fraction f of data processing executed at the cloud versus at fog servers. This determination requires that we consider that the processing capacity of fog servers is typically smaller than that of cloud servers. On the other hand, it may be more expensive to use cloud resources as opposed to fog servers. As f increases, more data has to be sent and received from the cloud. On the other hand, fog servers are typically resource-constrained and may not have enough capacity to handle requests from numerous sensors and other IoT devices and may become a bottleneck. The contributions of this paper are: (1) An autonomic controller, called FogQN-AC, that dynamically changes the fraction of data processing performed at the cloud. The controller seeks to optimize a utility function of the average response time and cost. This utility function uses an analytic response time and cost model previously developed by the authors. (2) An assessment of the controller against a brute-force optimal solution.

This computing paradigm therefore presents a low capital and low barrier alternative to operating dedicated eScience infrastructure. Indeed, commercial clouds now enable universal access to capabilities previously available to only large well funded research groups. While the potential benefits of cloud computing are clear, there are still significant technical hurdles associated with obtaining the best execution efficiency whilst trading off cost. Large scale scientific analyses are typically represented as workflows, in order to manage multiple tools and data sets. Mapping workflow tasks on to a set of provisioned instances is an example of the general scheduling problem and is NP-complete. In this case, the mapping includes elasticity, where as part of the mapping process additional instances may be provisioned. In this paper we present anew algorithm, Proportional Deadline Constrained (PDC), that addresses eScience workflow scheduling in the cloud. PDC's aim is to minimize costs while meeting deadline constraints. To validate the PDC algorithm, we constructed a Cloud Sim test bed and compared PDC with two other similar algorithms over three workflows. Our results demonstrate that overall PDC achieves generally lower costs for a given deadline, but more significantly, is usually able to construct a viable schedule with tight deadlines where the other algorithms studied cannot.",,978-1-5090-1849-9,10.1109/NCA.2015.33,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371711,Workflow Scheduling;Scientific Applications;Commercial Clouds;QoS constrained scheduling,Cloud computing;Scheduling;Schedules;Partitioning algorithms;Scheduling algorithms;Quality of service,cloud computing;optimisation;scheduling;scientific information systems,Cloud Sim test bed;PDC algorithm;deadline constraints;eScience workflow scheduling;mapping process;NP-complete;general scheduling problem;workflow tasks;cloud computing;eScience infrastructure;pay-as-you-go cost model;elasticity;scientific analysis;commercial clouds;proportional deadline constrained scientific workflow scheduling;cost effective scientific workflow scheduling,,11.0,,32.0,IEEE,7 Jan 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emergence of virtualization and cloud computing has produced an improved aim on chargeback. Chargeback is a widely used process to regulate IT costs, by charging departments proportional to their usage; it ensures efficient use of the available resources, making departments aware of their IT usages and associated costs. Key Features of Chargeback is to create customizable cost models, report infrastructure costs accurately and drive accountability in cloud environments. Chargeback collects information regarding important virtual machine events from Cloud Server using Data Collector. After the initial inventory synchronization, Data Collector updates as and when the event occurs at Server. But if Data Collector goes down we miss important events of Vitual Machine.

In that situation, both providers and customers may benefit greatly from advanced reservation of virtual resources, i.e. virtual machines.

Thereby, we are able to verify, record and manage the infrastructure resources efficiently. Based on that model, service providers can easily verify the available capacity for satisfying the customer's Quality-of-Service requirements.

Moreover, SLAC supports the business aspects of the domain, such as pricing schemes, business actions and metrics.

Customers acquire and release resources by requesting and returning virtual machines to the cloud. Different service models and pricing schemes are offered by cloud service providers. This can make it difficult for customers to compare cloud services and select an appropriate solution. Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service vendors offer a t-shirt approach for Virtual Machines (VMs) on demand. Customers can select from a set of fixed size VMs and vary the number of VMs as their demands change. Private clouds often offer another alternative, called time-sharing, where the capacity of each VM is permitted to change dynamically. With this approach each virtual machine is allocated a dynamic amount of CPU and memory resources over time to better utilize available resources. We present a tool that can help customers make informed decisions about which approach works most efficiently for their workloads in aggregate and for each workload separately. A case study using data from an enterprise customer with 312 workloads demonstrates the use of the tool. It shows that for the given set of workloads the t-shirt model requires almost twice the number of physical servers as the time share model. The costs for such infrastructure must ultimately be passed on to the customer in terms of monetary costs or performance risks.

However, how to minimize the operational cost with Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee when outsourcing SFC is still an open problem. In this paper, we are to study this problem when there are large number of candidate cloud providers with diverse pricing schemes of network functions. In addition, extra delay is introduced as the result of outsourcing SFCs. Firstly, we formulate this problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model.

This relationship can be recursive. Software as a service (SaaS) providers may not own their infrastructure. If their expertise is on the application domain, they will have a strong incentive to focus on their area of strength and in turn delegate the infrastructure provisioning to an IaaS provider. Under these relationships, there is inherently less transparency about the service components when services cross organizational boundaries as in private clouds or even company boundaries. It is difficult to implement manageability policies for a composite application made of outsourced components. For instance, there is no widely adopted method for service providers to report the energy consumption of their respective services nor there exist enforcement mechanisms to impose power limitations. These mechanisms would be needed to comply with regulations to report the carbon footprint of an application as a whole. Static estimation methods can be devised, but they require generous safety margins because they are inherently inaccurate. If these estimates are used to calculate a carbon emissions tax, it is in the economic interest of the organization to make these estimates as accurate as possible. Needed in this environment are mechanisms for service metadata exchange, information about the service itself. Service providers with this capability will have a first mover advantage, allowing their service consumers to implement global energy policies. The provider could implement innovative pricing schemes, such as lowering the baseline charges for the services in exchange for the service consumer covering and assuming the risks for energy consumption.

The developers can obtain the desired services from the cloud service providers (CSPs) and can pay on a usage basis. However, each CSP offers different pricing schemes, locates in different regions, and provides a different set of services. Therefore, it is challenging for the developers to select the CSPs. As a solution, the Cloud Analyst tool was developed to support large-scale applications for developers. It provides three service broker policies, namely closest data center (CDC), optimize response time (ORT) and reconfigure dynamically with load (RDL), and three load balancing policies, namely round robin (RR), equally spread current execution load (ESCEL) and throttled (TH). These policies map the user bases (UBs) to the data centers (DCs) and further map to the virtual machines (VMs) of the DCs, respectively. The performance of these policies is assessed in terms of four measures, namely load assignment, overall response time, DC request servicing time, and total cost. In this paper, we propose one service broker policy, one VM provisioning policy, and one load balancing policy and compare their performance with existing service broker policies and existing load balancing policies, respectively.

This decision should maximize the utilization of the internal infrastructure and minimize the cost of running the outsourced tasks in the cloud, while taking into account the applications' quality of service constraints. Such decisions are generally hard to take by hand, because there are many cost factors, pricing models and cloud provider offerings to consider.

This presents opportunities for optimizing the execution of application workflows with heterogeneous and dynamic requirements, and tackling larger scale problems. In this paper, we introduce a framework to manage the end-to-end execution of data-intensive application workflows in dynamic software-defined resource federation. This framework enables the autonomic execution of workflows by elastically provisioning an appropriate set of resources that meet application requirements, and by adapting this set of resources at runtime as the requirements change.

Meanwhile, cloud computing providers such as Amazon and Microsoft allow users to lease computing resources where users are charged based on the amount of time they reserve each server, with no consideration of utilization. One key factor that affects server utilization is partitioning method especially in data-driven location-based services. Because if the data partitions are not accessed, the servers storing them remain idle but the user is still charged. Whereas, existing spatial data partitioning techniques aim to 1) cluster spatially close data objects to minimize disk I/O and 2) create equi-sized partitions. On the contrary, the objective is different for cloud given the current pricing models.

We address the problem of dynamic resource allocation in a federated vehicular cloud. We propose a dynamic resource pricing model for sharing resources between the cloud providers, based on which we formulate resource allocation as an optimization problem. The objective is to minimize the cost of the vehicular service provider while meeting the delay bounds of different vehicular applications, for which a cost and delay-aware, polynomial-time algorithm is proposed. We evaluate the proposed algorithm under different scenarios to show that exploiting federation brings great benefits for the service providers and end-users alike. The proposed algorithm is seen to meet the delay requirements with a significant cost reduction to the provider up to 50% compared to baseline methods.

Due to elasticity and on-demand nature that cloud computing provides, more and more video service providers (VSP) utilize cloud infrastructures to provide cloud-based video applications. In this work, we propose Cloud Live Video Streaming (CLVS) - a new approach to efficiently stream live video that is based on Amazon S3 pricing model. In the design of CLVS, when a source video is being recorded by a mobile device, on which then it is segmented and encoded. Next, those video segments are pushed into a designated Amazon S3 bucket. On end-user devices, the client program of CLVS directly retrieves the most recent video segment from the S3 bucket, then performs decoding and video playing back. By using Amazon S3 service, our CLVS employs what is referred to as a “serverless” design by eliminating the needs for an intermediary and persistently running streaming server. Thus, VSPs do not have to pay for the idle time found on the traditional streaming servers, but still are able to continually provide live video streams to end viewers. We implement a prototype of CLVS and optimize its performance by using multithreaded prefetching and caching techniques. In experiments, we compare our CLVS with an existing video streaming software - Wowza Streaming Engine. Experiment results indicate that CLVS not only outperforms Wowza in many aspects of video streaming performance, but also financially costs less.",,978-1-5386-4649-6,10.1109/CCWC.2018.8301615,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8301615,Cloud computing;Live Video Streaming;Cloud Storage Service,Streaming media;Cloud computing;Servers;Indexes;Pricing;Instruction sets,cloud computing;mobile handsets;multimedia communication;video signal processing;video streaming,live video streaming approach;Amazon S3 pricing model;mainstream media source;video service providers;cloud infrastructures;cloud-based video applications;Cloud Live Video Streaming;CLVS;source video;video segments;Amazon S3 service;traditional streaming servers;Wowza Streaming Engine;video streaming performance;video streaming software;Amazon S3 bucket;VSP,,6.0,,29.0,USGov,26 Feb 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, many service providers today are competing to enhance their features and attract more customers as they are offering them a bunch of services through a pay-asyou-go pricing model. However, despite their huge fame, cloud environments still suffer from some issues that are being studied by researchers from various perspectives. One of the controversial cloud issues nowadays is interference among virtual machines (VMs) sharing the same hardware platform called also physical machine (PM). This problem occurs due to contention on shared resources between co-hosted VMs which results in performance degradation. Resource contention happens when demand for shared resources exceeds the supply due to VMs cohosting. The co-hosting of VMs on the same PM, emerges from the ambition of server consolidation that cloud providers aim to reach in order to improve power efficiency and optimize resource utilization. Therefore, the key factor of successful server consolidation is to minimize performance interference among colocated VMs. In this paper, we are going to reveal the interference issue as well as its major cause, survey existing researchers' visions to detect and/or predict such issue and exhibit a comparative study between them. Then we will reveal some challenging points that require further consideration.

Cost, control and capabilities are key factors in decision making of enterprises on whether to migrate their existing applications on public or private cloud infrastructure. Over the first decade of cloud computing adoption, most of the enterprises began with over-conservatism towards public cloud, based mainly on concerns of steady state workload cost and control. The majority of enterprises have now settled in to middle ground approach with hybrid cloud based on their expectation of cost benefits and sustained control from private infrastructure for some of their applications. For new applications development, public cloud is increasingly favored for allocation of applications. Private cloud platforms e.g. VMware and Openstack have become easier to use and deploy. The private cloud platforms have closed the gap in ease of rapid application development as container platforms and cloud management have advanced in offering orchestration and capabilities competitive with public cloud services. However, public cloud platforms are suited for firms willing to sacrifice long-term application portability for less operational workload and short-term quicker development. The enterprises are keeping many of their applications on private infrastructure for security, compliance or auditing reasons. The enterprises should not oversimplify their cost considerations while identifying the applications that can run on either public or private cloud as this may leave risks of a lot of cost-saving opportunities on table. The key to cost analysis is to determine first, how well one can profile infrastructure capacity needs and second, how efficiently one can operate their private infrastructure.",,978-1-7281-0006-7,10.1109/BigDataSecurity-HPSC-IDS.2019.00064,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8819479,"Cloud Computing, OpenStack Business Strategy, Reinventing the business model, Disruptive Innovation",Cloud computing;Security;Software as a service;Business;Computational modeling;Industries,cloud computing;decision making,private cloud platforms;rapid application development;cloud management;public cloud services;public cloud platforms;long-term application portability;operational workload;short-term quicker development;enterprises;private infrastructure;public cloud deployment debate;steady state workload cost;hybrid cloud;cost benefits;applications development;public cloud computing adoption,,1.0,,18.0,IEEE,29 Aug 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, Cloud Computing has emerged as a new paradigm for on-demand delivery of computing resources. However, scientific computing community has been quite hesitant in using the Cloud, simply because traditional programming models do not fit well with the new paradigm, and the earliest cloud programming models do not allow most scientific computations being efficiently run in the Cloud. In this paper we explore and compare two distributed computing models: the MPI (message-passing interface) model, that is high-performance oriented, and the Spark model, which is throughput oriented but outperforms other cloud programming solutions adding improved support for iterative algorithms through in-memory computing.

In particular, the database-as-a-service (DaaS) market is rapidly expanding. Attempts to improve database performance have led to the use of nonvolatile memory as a durable database medium instead of existing storage devices. However, the CPU architecture of different physical servers may be of different generations. For database systems running on a cloud infrastructure, the cost of storing databases in nonvolatile memory decreases and the cost of CPU operation increases relative to choosing the most suitable execution plan for a database query. In our previous study, we proposed a measurement-based join cost calculation method to select the best join method. However, when the cost calculation method is not portable to database systems with a CPU with architecture differing from that of the CPU used to measure the statistical information, re-measuring the statistical information, and recreating the cost calculation model becomes necessary. The current study is aimed at developing a method for updating the measurement-based cost calculation formula to support a CPU with architecture from a different generation without the need to re-measure the statistical information of the CPU. Our approach focuses on reflecting architectural changes, such as cache size and associativity, memory latency, and branch misprediction penalty, in the components of the cost calculation formulas. The updated cost evaluation formulas estimated the cost of joining different generation-based CPUs accurately in 66% of the test cases.

Scientific applications usually require significant resources, however not all scientists have access to sufficient high-end computing systems. Cloud computing has gained the attention of scientists as a competitive resource to run HPC applications at a potentially lower cost. But as a different infrastructure, it is unclear whether clouds are capable of running scientific applications with a reasonable performance per money spent. This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of EC2 cloud in different aspects. We first analyze the potentials of the cloud by evaluating the raw performance of different services of AWS such as compute, memory, network and I/O. Based on the findings on the raw performance, we then evaluate the performance of the scientific applications running in the cloud. Finally, we compare the performance of AWS with a private cloud, in order to find the root cause of its limitations while running scientific applications. This paper aims to assess the ability of the cloud to perform well, as well as to evaluate the cost of the cloud in terms of both raw performance and scientific applications performance. Furthermore, we evaluate other services including S3, EBS and DynamoDB among many AWS services in order to assess the abilities of those to be used by scientific applications and frameworks. We also evaluate a real scientific computing application through the Swift parallel scripting system at scale.

Although an abundance of mechanisms already facilitate the lease and use of single infrastructure resources, to complete multi-job workloads IaaS users still need to select adequate provisioning and allocation policies to instantiate resources and map computational jobs to them. While such policies have been studied in the past, no experimental investigation in the context of clouds currently exists that considers them jointly. In this paper we present a comprehensive and empirical performance-cost analysis of provisioning and allocation policies in IaaS clouds. We first introduce a taxonomy of both types of policies, based on the type of information used in the decision process, and map to this taxonomy eight provisioning and four allocation policies. Then, we analyze the performance and cost of these policies through experimentation in three clouds, including Amazon EC2.

Classical resource allocation methods for query optimization need to be revised to handle the pricing models in cloud environnements. In this work, we propose a resource allocation method for the query optimization in the cloud based on Integer Linear-Programming (ILP).

Many believe that Cloud computing is making an industry-wise paradigm shift for IT use. Besides its technique issues, the business feature of Cloud computing attracts our interests. Specifically the practice of Amazon EC2 introduces an interesting pricing scheme. Amazon provides users with virtual computing instances as a combination of interruptible service (i.e., spot instance) and uninterruptible service (i.e., on-demand and reserved instance). Spot instance is charged at a per use price which is dynamically changing over time; users of spot instance face the risk of service termination on the provider's side. In this paper, we build a multiple-stage game to study users' best job submission strategy under such a mixed pricing scheme, and to analyze the potential benefits and influence of such pricing scheme. We identify user-segments that will take different job submission strategies, and show that users should reserve resource for future high-value job arrivals.

As in many basic utilities, such as electricity and water, consumers/clients in cloud computing environments are charged based on their service usage, hence the term ‘pay-per-use’. While this pricing model is very appealing for both service providers and consumers, fluctuating service request volume and conflicting objectives (e.g., profit vs. response time) between providers and consumers hinder its effective application to cloud computing environments. In this paper, we address the problem of service request scheduling in cloud computing systems. We consider a three-tier cloud structure, which consists of infrastructure vendors, service providers and consumers, the latter two parties are particular interest to us. Clearly, scheduling strategies in this scenario should satisfy the objectives of both parties.

Despite such benefits and benchmarking advances, costs are still quite unpredictable, performance is unclear, security is inconsistent, and there is minimal control over aspects like data and service locality. Estimating performance of cloud environments is very hard for cloud consumers. They would like to make informed decisions about which provider better suits their needs using specialized evaluation mechanisms. Providers have their own tools reporting specific metrics, but they are potentially biased and often incomparable across providers. Current benchmarking tools allow comparison but consumers need more flexibility to evaluate environments under actual operating conditions for specialized applications. Ours is early stage work and a step towards a monitoring solution that enables independent evaluation of clouds for very specific application needs. In this paper, we present our initial architecture of the Cloud Monitor that aims to integrate existing and new benchmarks in a flexible and extensible way.

However, current auto-scaling mechanisms in cloud lack the critical self-adaption policy which helps application providers decide on when and how to reallocate resources. Furthermore, virtualization techniques can not ensure an absolute isolation between multiple virtual machines sharing the same physical resource, which leads to some customers paying unfairly for heavy-loaded resource under a widely-adopted fixed pricing scheme.In this paper, we present a global performance-to-price model based on game theory, in which each application is considered as a selfish player attempting to guarantee QoS requirements and simultaneously minimize the resource cost. Then we apply the idea of Nash equilibrium to obtain the appropriate allocation, and an approximated solution is proposed to obtain the Nash equilibrium, ensuring that each player is charged fairly for their desired performance. First, each player maximizes its utility independently without considering the placement of virtual machines. Then based on the initial allocation, each player reaches its optimal placement solely without considering others' interference.

Electricity is a major contributor to the cloud's recurring costs and may increase significantly in the near future. As the cloud market gets more competitive, there will be a need for more cost-conscious dynamic pricing design. Additionally, today's cloud provider's pricing mechanisms act almost oblivious to the fact that the large tenants of the cloud are able to perform automated demand response in the form of delaying and dropping jobs. In this work we introduce differential dynamic pricing which provides different tenants with tailored prices according to their price sensitivity, while accounting for each tenant's energy costs. Furthermore, the cloud providers can engage in demand response to utility prices using on-site batteries. Battery management complicates things further, as it brings in additional costs, e.g., wear-and-tear, which is challenging to attribute to each tenant. So, we use virtual battery management which accounts for individual tenant's usage of batteries. We also, show how virtual battery management can alleviate possible price fluctuations and act in synergy with differential dynamic pricing scheme and result in a less variable and more predictable (stable) pricing framework, called Stable Differential Dynamic Pricing (SD2P). We navigate different real-world IBM tenants' incident power demands with different price elasticities in conjunction with real-world electricity prices, and realistic battery degradation costs, to show the efficacy of our pricing mechanism. We show that under SD2P cloud's profit increases up to 31% while average tenants' utility increases up to 18%. Prices under SD2P exhibit up to 54% less variation compared to other dynamic pricing schemes, as a result of engaging the batteries at times of energy price spikes.",,,10.1145/3208903.3208938,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,Conference Paper,Public Cloud Differential Pricing Design Under Provider and Tenants Joint Demand Response,2018.0,21–32,"New York, NY, USA",Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Future Energy Systems,"Karlsruhe, Germany",2018,9781450357678.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3208903.3208938;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3208903.3208938,"Differential Pricing, Cloud Provider, Dynamic Pricing, Demand Response",,e-Energy '18,,,,,,,,

However, this pricing scheme, similar to the uniform price auction, is truthful only when supply can be adjusted, such as the case of a standalone cloud provider. In a federated cloud, where resources from multiple cloud providers are integrated to increase elasticity and reliability, rational users can have a greater impact.

Users of these systems are rational and maximize their own interest when consuming and contributing shared resources, even if by doing so they affect the overall efficiency of the system. To manage rational users, resource pricing and allocation can provide the necessary incentives for users to behave such that the overall efficiency can be maximized. In this paper, we propose a dynamic pricing mechanism for the allocation of shared resources, and evaluate its performance. In contrast with several existing trading models, our scheme is designed to allocate a request with multiple resource types, such that the user does not have to aggregate different resource types manually.

When the cloud infrastructure consists of heterogeneous servers, the mapping between mobile devices and servers plays an important role in determining the energy dissipation on both sides. From an environmental impact perspective, any energy dissipation related to computation should be counted. To achieve energy sustainability, it is important reducing the overall energy consumption of the mobile systems and the cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, reducing cloud energy consumption can potentially reduce the cost of mobile cloud users because the pricing model of cloud services is pay-by-usage. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic approach to optimize the overall energy in a mobile cloud computing system. We formulate the energy minimization problem as a congestion game, where each mobile device is a player and his strategy is to select one of the servers to offload the computation while minimizing the overall energy consumption. We prove that the Nash equilibrium always exists in this game and propose an efficient algorithm that could achieve the Nash equilibrium in polynomial time. Experimental results show that our approach is able to reduce the total energy of mobile devices and servers compared to a random approach and an approach which only tries to reduce mobile devices alone.",,,10.1145/2333660.2333724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,Conference Paper,A Game Theoretic Resource Allocation for Overall Energy Minimization in Mobile Cloud Computing System,2012.0,279–284,"New York, NY, USA",Proceedings of the 2012 ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design,"Redondo Beach, California, USA",2012,9781450312493.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/2333660.2333724;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2333660.2333724,"congestion game, game theory, virtualization, power management, mobile cloud computing",,ISLPED '12,,,,,,,,

Resource allocation in these environments, where both providers and consumers are selfish agents, presents numerous challenges since the number of consumers and their resource demand is highly dynamic. While numerous auction-based approaches have been proposed in the literature, this paper explores an alternative approach where providers and consumers automatically negotiate resource leasing contracts. Since resource demand and supply can be dynamic and uncertain, we propose a distributed negotiation mechanism where agents negotiate over both a contract price and a decommitment penalty, which allows agents to decommit from contracts at a cost.

In general, the VM instance is allocated to cloud service users based on not actual job processing time but the fixed resource allocation time predetermined by cloud pricing policy in contrast to grid environment. In this case, the unnecessary cost dissipation is occurred by the wasted partial instance hours of allocated resource. To address this problem, we propose the heuristic based workflow scheduling scheme considering cloud-pricing model in this paper. Our scheme is composed of two phases: VM packing and MRSR (Multi Requests to Single Resource) phases. In VM-packing phase, preassigned multi tasks are aggregated into the common VM instance sequentially, and these tasks are merged in parallel by MRSR phase. By using our proposed schemes, we are able to reduce the number of required VM instances and achieve the significant cost saving while we guarantee the user's SLA (Service Level Agreement) in terms of workflow deadline.

Customers acquire and release resources by requesting and returning virtual machines to the cloud. Different service models and pricing schemes are offered by cloud service providers.

Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service vendors offer a t-shirt approach for Virtual Machines (VMs) on demand. Customers can select from a set of fixed size VMs and vary the number of VMs as their demands change. Private clouds often offer another alternative, called time-sharing, where the capacity of each VM is permitted to change dynamically. With this approach each virtual machine is allocated a dynamic amount of CPU and memory resources over time to better utilize available resources. We present a tool that can help customers make informed decisions about which approach works most efficiently for their workloads in aggregate and for each workload separately. A case study using data from an enterprise customer with 312 workloads demonstrates the use of the tool. It shows that for the given set of workloads the t-shirt model requires almost twice the number of physical servers as the time share model.

Large-scale distributed systems offer computational services to scientists, consumers and enterprises. Efficient management of distributed resources is crucial to use effectively the power of these systems and achieve good performance. Large-scale distributed systems are usually real-time as they are used for serving applications which require real-time processing. It is essential that appropriate resource allocation and scheduling techniques are utilized ensuring timeliness. Cloud computing, as a large-scale distributed computing paradigm based on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, has been extensively used for the deployment of complex computationally intensive applications. Particularly important in cloud computing is to run delay-sensitive applications. This can be achieved due to cloud’s high-performance computing capabilities for real-time execution. However, approaches to resolve other issues such as cost and energy conservation are necessary. In the last years, there is an expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT). There is a plethora of IoT applications which generate huge amounts of data and it is important to process these data in real-time and provide fast decisions. As a result, fog computing has emerged as a computing model which extends the cloud to the edge of the network, thus reducing the latency of IoT data transmission. The computational capacity of fog resources is usually limited, therefore it is necessary to employ algorithms that involve the collaboration between the cloud and fog resources. Consequently, appropriate scheduling of time-sensitive applications is required to exploit the capacity of cloud and fog computing so that the workload’s deadlines are met.

The users aiming for the spot market are presented with many instance types placed in multiple datacenters in the world, and thus it is difficult to choose the optimal deployment. In this paper, we propose the framework SpotADAPT (Spot-Aware (re-)Deployment of Analytical Processing Tasks) which is designed to help users by first, estimating the workload execution time on different AWS instance types, and, second, proposing the deployment (i.e., specific availability zone, instance type, pricing model) aligned with user-provided optimization goals (fastest or cheapest execution within boundaries). Moreover, during the execution of the workload, SpotADAPT suggests a redeployment if the current spot instance gets terminated by Amazon or a better deployment becomes possible due to fluctuations of the spot prices. The approach is evaluated using the actual execution times of typical analytical workloads and real spot price traces.

However, being shared by a large number of users, the running of applications in the platform faces higher performance uncertainty compared to a dedicated platform. Existing Service Level Agreements (SLAs) cannot sufficiently address the performance variation issue.

Based on the utility model, we design a mechanism to support utility-based SLAs in order to balance the performance of applications and the cost of running them. We consider an infrastructure-as-a-service type cloud platform (e.g., Amazon EC2), where a business service provider leases virtual machine (VM) instances with spot prices from the cloud and gains revenue by serving its customers. Particularly, we investigate the interaction of service profit and customer satisfaction. In addition, we present two scheduling algorithms that can effectively bid for different types of VM instances to make tradeoffs between profit and customer satisfaction.

Customers arrive to the system according to a stochastic process and upon arrival decide whether or not to purchase the service, depending on their willingness-to-pay and the current price. The service time during which the resource is used by the customer is stochastic and the firm may incur a service cost. This model represents various markets for reusable resources such as cloud computing, shared vehicles, rotable parts, and hotel rooms. In the present paper, we analyze this pricing problem when the firm attempts to maximize a weighted combination of three central metrics: profit, market share, and service level. Under Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, and standard assumptions on the willingness-to-pay distribution, we establish a series of results that characterize the performance of static pricing in such environments. In particular, while an optimal policy is fully dynamic in such a context, we prove that a static pricing policy simultaneously guarantees 78.9% of the profit, market share, and service level from the optimal policy. Notably, this result holds for any service rate and number of units the firm operates. In the special case where there are two units and the induced demand is linear, we also prove that the static policy guarantees 95.5% of the profit from the optimal policy.

While cloud services are following the pay-as-you-go pricing model, resources are billed based on instance allocation and not on the actual usage, leading the customers to be charged needlessly. In serverless computing, as exemplified by the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model where functions are the basic resources, functions are typically not allocated or charged until invoked or triggered. Functions are not applications, however, and to build compelling serverless applications they frequently need to be orchestrated with some kind of application logic. A major issue emerging by the use of orchestration is that it complicates further the already complex billing model used by FaaS providers, which in combination with the lack of granular billing and execution details offered by the providers makes the development and evaluation of serverless applications challenging.Towards shedding some light into this matter, in this work we extensively evaluate the state-of-the-art function orchestrator AWS Step Functions (ASF) with respect to its performance and cost. For this purpose we conduct a series of experiments using a serverless data processing pipeline application developed as both ASF Standard and Express workflows. Our results show that Step Functions using Express workflows are economical when running short-lived tasks with many state transitions. In contrast, Standard workflows are better suited for long-running tasks, offering in addition detailed debugging and logging information.

Many problems in this field are extremely challenging and require substantial supercomputing resources to be solved. This is the case of parameter estimation in large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems biology models. Recently, Cloud Computing has emerged as a new paradigm for on-demand delivery of computing resources. However, scientific computing community has been quite hesitant in using the Cloud, simply because traditional programming models do not fit well with the new paradigm, and the earliest cloud programming models do not allow most scientific computations being efficiently run in the Cloud. In this paper we explore and compare two distributed computing models: the MPI (message-passing interface) model, that is high-performance oriented, and the Spark model, which is throughput oriented but outperforms other cloud programming solutions adding improved support for iterative algorithms through in-memory computing. The performance of a very well known metaheuristic, the Differential Evolution algorithm, has been thoroughly assessed using a challenging parameter estimation problem from the domain of computational systems biology.

Although an abundance of mechanisms already facilitate the lease and use of single infrastructure resources, to complete multi-job workloads IaaS users still need to select adequate provisioning and allocation policies to instantiate resources and map computational jobs to them. While such policies have been studied in the past, no experimental investigation in the context of clouds currently exists that considers them jointly. In this paper we present a comprehensive and empirical performance-cost analysis of provisioning and allocation policies in IaaS clouds. We first introduce a taxonomy of both types of policies, based on the type of information used in the decision process, and map to this taxonomy eight provisioning and four allocation policies. Then, we analyze the performance and cost of these policies through experimentation in three clouds, including Amazon EC2. We show that policies that dynamically provision and/or allocate resources can achieve better performance and cost.

High performance and distributed GIS (HPDGIS) have emerged as a growing area of theoretical and applied research. This growth is driven by geospatial problems in numerous fields that are increasingly computationally intensive and require collaboration support. Efficient handling of massive spatial databases, shared and role-based access to distributed data, and high end computing services are fundamental to the near-real-time response times required for many GIS and associated decision support applications.The initial feasibility and tremendous potential of HPDGIS have recently been demonstrated by exploiting rapidly developing cyberinfrastructure capabilities. It is therefore important to bring together researchers and practitioners to map out fundamental research areas centered on HPDGIS and its tight connections to advances in high performance computing, distributed systems, and associated GIS and spatial analysis applications and this inaugural ACM SIGSPATIAL HPDGIS 2010 is designed to do just that. This proceeding contains papers selected for publication and presentation, to this HPDGIS'10 workshop, held at San Jose, California, USA on November 2, 2010 in conjunction with the 18th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information System.This year's program also features an outstanding keynote talk titled as ""High Performance Computing with Spatial Datasets"" by Dr. Shashi Shekhar from the University of Minnesota.The workshop attracted research papers on a number of HPDGIS themes including data intensive GIS, parallel processing algorithms for GIS problems, GIS based on cloud computing, service-oriented GIS, and spatial middleware. Research papers: ""A MapReduce Approach to Gi*(d) Spatial Statistic"" and ""Spatial Scene Similarity Assessment on Hadoop"" illustrate the use of the map-reduce framework to resolve two typical data-intensive problems in GIS and spatial analysis. In ""Towards Personal High- Performance Geospatial Computing (HPC-G): Perspectives and a Case Study"", the author advocates the use of a low cost personal HPDGIS environment developed by using parallel computing capability afforded by Graphic Processing Unit architecture. A theoretical framework for modeling the cost of a distributed service on cloud is discussed in ""A Cost Model for Distributed Coverage Processing Services"", while the paper titled as ""Cloud Computing for Geosciences: Deployment of GEOSS Clearinghouse on Amazon's EC2"" experimentally demonstrates the use of cloud computing for GIS and spatial analysis.

The poor interconnect and I/O performance in cloud, HPC-agnostic cloud schedulers, and the inherent heterogeneity and multi-tenancy in cloud are some bottlenecks for HPC in cloud. This means that the tremendous potential of cloud for both HPC users and providers remains underutilized.

We also discuss our struggle to build meaningful micro-benchmarks and gather workloads representative of real-world applications to stress-test our systems.
